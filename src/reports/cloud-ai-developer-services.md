# Cloud AI Developer Services

Business leaders and boards of directors expect software engineering leaders and their teams to deliver the promised benefits of AI. Cloud AI developer services help deliver these benefits by offering an end-to-end platform to design, develop, deploy and monitor language, vision and tabular AI models.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines cloud AI developer services (CAIDS) as cloud-hosted or containerized services and products that enable software developers who are not data science experts to use artificial intelligence (AI) models via APIs, software development kits (SDKs) or applications.Core capabilities include automated machine learning (autoML) including automated data preparation,automated feature engineering and automated model building, and model management and operationalization for language, vision and tabular use cases. Optional and important complementary capabilities include AI code models and assistants.

Cloud AI developer services help organizations embed intelligence, such as AI and ML insights,into their applications. While that is what cloud AI developer services offer, it is more important tonote how they accomplish this. These services democratize and increase the availability of AI and ML to software engineers through the automation and features offered.
Traditional activities regarding data acquisition, data quality, feature engineering, algorithm selection and model training are augmented by the technology. Cloud AI developer services open up a world of possibilities for software engineers to build AI and ML production capabilities and features for enterprise-built applications.
