# CSP 5G RAN Infrastructure Solutions

This Magic Quadrant helps communications service providers identify and evaluate network equipment providers for their 5G RAN infrastructure. It will guide CSP chief technology officers (CTOs) toward the right 5G RAN vendor choices in a complex and rapidly evolving market.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the market of communications service provider (CSP) 5G radio access network (RAN) infrastructure solutions as consisting of hardware and software components that support CSPs in providing connectivity services. Such services include mobile broadband, fixed wireless access and voice communication over a 3rd GenerationPartnership Project (3GPP)-based 5G network. Gartner considers 5G to be a foundational technology, implemented to evolve a CSP’s services, including in the consumer and enterprise business sectors. This CSP 5G RAN infrastructure market encompasses CSPs’ deployment of RAN solutions for public 5G.

5G RAN infrastructure solutions mainly support CSPs in upgrading their existing 4G RAN infrastructure, while providing an enhanced user experience and keeping costs under control. For instance, the introduction of 5G massive multiple input/multiple output (MIMO)and dynamic spectrum sharing between 4G and 5G can improve user throughput and rapidly expand 5G coverage. These solutions not only enhance network quality, but also serve as part of the 5G platforms addressing challenges faced by enterprises.
