# Accounts Payable Applications

Accounts payable applications use a single platform with automation and predictive capabilities for supplier invoice processing, payment facilitation and supplier master data management. CFOs can use this research to assess vendors that enable the digital transformation of AP processes.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the accounts payable applications market as cloud-based applications that enable corporate controllers and their teams to automatically manage supplier invoice processing, facilitate payments and support supplier master data management across one or more ERP applications.

Organizations use accounts payable applications to improve their supplier invoice processing, payments and supplier master data management activities. They allow organizations to efficiently and confidently pay supplier invoices. These applications are modular cloud-based tools that customers can configure to deliver standard processes and integrate with one or more ERP applications. Additionally, they integrate with other operational tools, such as source-to-pay suites, partner networks, banks and payment service providers, while creating flexibility for suppliers to deliver supplier invoices. An example would be the collection and processing of supplier invoices using a digital mailroom, whereby data (structured and unstructured) is extracted from scanned documents and validated prior to approval for payment.

The most common business problems the accounts payable applications market addresses include:

**Efficiency**— The ability to automate and streamline accounts payable operations by eliminating time-consuming and error-prone manual processes. This use case focuses on an organization’s goal to drive efficiency and productivity within their accounts payable processes.

**Managing cash flow** — The ability to gain insight into the organization’s disbursements component of cash flow by leveraging robust master data. Finance organizations often struggle to provide a real-time picture of the current cash flow that can impact operations.

**Financial controls** — The ability to facilitate a strong control environment including segregation of duties, financial and compliance controls and fraud prevention. By implementing accounts payable controls, organizations can enhance their financial management, reduce the risk of errors and fraud, and ensure they meet compliance requirements.
