# Integration Platform as a Service

Integration platform as a service enables organizations to connect the different applications, services and data that are needed for efficient business operations. This research assesses 16 iPaaS vendors to help software engineering leaders select the right vendors for their needs.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines integration platform as a service (iPaaS) as a vendor-managed cloud service that enables end users to implement integrations between applications, services and data sources, both internal and external to their organization.
iPaaS enables end users of the platform to integrate a variety of internal and external applications, services and data sources for at least one of the three main patterns of integration technology use:

- **Data consistency**: The ability to monitor for or be notified by applications, services and data sources about changes, and to propagate those changes to the appropriate applications and data destinations (for example, “synchronize customer data” or “ingest into data lake”).

- **Multistep process**: The ability to implement multistep processes between applications, services and data sources (for example, to “onboard employee” or “process insurance claim”).

- **Composite services**: The ability to create composite services exposed as APIs or events and composed from existing applications, services and data sources (for example, to create a “credit check” service or to create a “generate fraud score” service).

These integration use cases are most commonly implemented via intuitive low-code or no-code developer environments, though some vendors provide more complex developer tooling.
