# Decision Intelligence Platforms

Decision intelligence platforms (DIPs) combine decision modeling, analytics, and AI to augment and automate decision making and drive business outcomes. Leaders responsible for decision intelligence can use these insights to invest in DIPs and boost their organization’s decision-centricity.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines decision intelligence platforms (DIPs) as software to create decision-centric solutions that support, augment and automate decision making of humans or machines, powered by the composition of data, analytics, knowledge and AI. DIPs enable enterprises to collaboratively design and explicitly model decisions, orchestrate decision flow during execution at scale, and enable monitoring and governance of decision quality, while learning from actions and outcomes. Features can include a combination of rule- and logic-based techniques, machine learning, real-time event stream processing, business intelligence, multimodal data and analytics preparation, natural language, graph technology, optimization, simulation or AI agents for decision intelligence.

DIPs provide a solution to enhance how organizations make decisions, whether by humans or machines, individually or collectively. They address the growing challenge of making timely and accurate decisions in volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous ecosystems, for more demanding customers in disruptive, competitive and regulated markets. DIPs help by creating executable decision models that improve decision service composition and all-source intelligence to achieve better situational awareness, better recommendations or autonomous actions, tailored to specific decisions and outcomes. They can reduce the risk of poor decisions, allow organizations to anticipate change and respond more swiftly to opportunities at scale.

DIPs help an organization achieve the following outcomes:

**Improved decision making** — With the ability to model decisions and orchestrate decision flows, DIPs make the decision making life cycle structured and transparent, and decision services more adaptive based on learning from their environment, leading to better outcomes.

**Increased efficiency** — Augmenting and automating decision making at scale saves time and resources, utilizing prescriptive analytics so teams can focus on more strategic tasks.

**Enhanced collaboration** — Collaborative decision modeling and execution help ensure interdependent and diverse perspectives are considered, leading to more comprehensive and trusted decisions.

**Better governance and accountability** — The ability to explain, evaluate, govern and audit decisions ensures organizations can learn from past actions and continuously improve trust, safety and compliance with regulations.

DIPs offer a coherent, contextual, connected, compliant, cost-optimized, collaborative, and continuous approach to high-quality decision making in today’s complex world. By optimizing the use of data, AI and other technology, they drive decision quality and better business outcomes.
