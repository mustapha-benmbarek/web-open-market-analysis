# Digital Technology and Business Consulting Services

Digital technology and business consulting services increasingly reflect the seamless integration of information, technology and business strategy, with interconnected initiatives spanning disciplines.

## Market Definition

Digital technology and business consulting services reflect the intermingled nature of information, technology and business. This market is increasingly driven by joined, interdependent actions and initiatives, rather than characterized by layers of the traditional technology stack. Digital technology and business consulting services are project-based consulting services that create the ambition and design for information, technology and business processes for clients.

Digital technology and business consulting services leverage the expertise of skilled business and technology specialists to help clients affect strategic change and achieve sustainable operational improvements. These services are consumed by clients across all industries depending on the use cases described below.

**Digital Business Consulting Services**
Digital business consulting services are contractually engaged by clients with the objective of generating increased business value by using digital technologies to optimize clients’ operating models and transform their business models. Business consulting services included in Gartner’s services forecast are limited to advisory services that preface, enable or influence IT adoption.

**Digital Marketing and Brand Strategy Consulting Services**
Digital marketing services involve developing and executing marketing strategies for global brands. Brand strategy services help clients crystallize a differentiated strategic market position and bring that strategy to life to drive the organization’s growth.

**Digital Technology and Cloud Enablement Consulting Services**
Consulting services that align ambition and design phases of back office IT environments and systems with a focus on cost, convenience and day-to-day operations — particularly in leveraging cloud-based technologies. These consulting services enable digital business transformation initiatives, acting as the underlying technical architecture and fabric for transformation. Technology Consulting segments include Application Technology Consulting, Infrastructure Technology Consulting, and Technology Strategy and Governance.

**Digital Product Engineering Consulting Services**
Consulting services that support organizations seeking to develop products and services relying heavily on digital sources of value creation — which are customizable, interactive, intelligent or connected. These services may include help with the design of products or services or unique customer experiences. Co-creation in close partnership with the client organization — whether virtual or in a physical lab environment — is often a key aspect of these services.
