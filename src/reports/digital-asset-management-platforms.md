# Digital Asset Management Platforms

Digital asset management platforms enable organizations to govern the creation, distribution and organization of digital assets. Digital marketing leaders can use this research to understand the market dynamics of DAMs and assess vendors’ ability to meet their organization’s requirements.

## Market Definition

Digital asset management (DAM) is a self-serve content repository. It facilitates the management, ingestion, storage, organization and distribution of all types of content an organization uses. The content includes any digital asset, such as text, graphics, images, videos, audio, design files and product information used by an organization to communicate with internal and external audiences. DAM platforms serve every part of the organization, including marketing, sales, HR, technology, manufacturing, legal, finance, call and service centers, third-party suppliers, agencies and distributors.

Beyond its role as a self-service solution, DAM products are part of a content operations ecosystem, which includes capabilities that overlap across technologies such as content marketing platforms (CMP), marketing work management (MWM) and product information management (PIM). Individually, technologies support different variations of content taxonomy, content editing, management of user-generated content and content access controls to third parties (e.g., agencies). Their goals are to drive efficiency, transparency and scale of content deliverables across the organization. The primary purpose of a DAM is to make digital assets available and useful, and ensure the assets are consistent with one’s brand across the organization.

DAM platforms serve as a repository for all digital content assets. Organizations that have a large number of digital assets use a DAM solution to manage, catalog and transfer files, and physically store digital assets. It allows organizations to share and edit digital assets across multiple platforms and channels. DAM platforms can support external partners by providing access to their own unique portal to access an organization’s assets. Overall, it is a self-service content repository and can facilitate collaboration.

The primary owners of a DAM are often referred to as admins, which are most likely found in marketing, but in some instances IT is the owner. DAM platforms are used to organize and filter user access to assets based on tags. DAM end-users (including, but not limited to, admins, creative teams, or marketing leaders) use a DAM to quickly upload assets in bulk for storage. Admins may also govern how, which portion of a template and where asset contents can be used. Increasingly, DAM’s ability to support content accessibility and machine vision or natural-language processing capabilities exposes an organization’s content to a wider range of groups.
