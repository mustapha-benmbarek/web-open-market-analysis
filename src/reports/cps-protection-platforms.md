# CPS Protection Platforms

Cyber-physical systems protection platforms that discover and protect assets in production or mission-critical environments are emerging as a leading market category. This research will help cybersecurity leaders find the right vendor to facilitate protection of CPS using CPS protection platforms.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the cyber-physical systems (CPS) protection platforms market as products that use knowledge of industrial protocols, operational/production network packets or traffic metadata, and physical process asset behavior to discover, categorize, map and protect CPS in production or mission-critical environments outside of enterprise IT environments. CPS protection platforms can be delivered from the cloud, on-premises or in hybrid form. Gartner defines CPS as engineered systems that orchestrate sensing, computation, control, networking and analytics to interact with the physical world (including humans). When secure, they enable safe, real-time, reliable, resilient and adaptable performance.

Whether in critical infrastructure, manufacturing, warehousing, transportation, utilities, building management or healthcare, every asset-intensive organization has CPS. They can be interchangeably called operational technology (OT), Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), smart building solutions, or Industrie 4.0. Whatever term organizations choose to adopt, these systems have one thing in common — they are managed digitally but interact with the real, physical world.
