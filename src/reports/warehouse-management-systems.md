# Warehouse Management Systems

WMS vendors are competing to resolve critical market demands like cost reduction, automation/robotics support, usability, adaptability and cloud services. Supply chain technology leaders can use this research to understand the current state of the WMS market and gain vendor insight.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines a warehouse management system (WMS) as a software application that helps manage and intelligently execute the operations of a warehouse, distribution center(DC) or fulfillment center (FC).

WMS operations natively exploit mobile devices along with bar codes and potentially RFID or other scanning/sensing technologies, to form the transactional foundation of warehouse management. This enables efficiencies of directed work activity (optimization) and the delivery of accurate information in near real time. Core WMS capabilities address, among others, the needs to receive, put away, store, count and pick, pack and ship goods. Gartner also includes additional integrated functionality offered by WMS providers beyond core WMS. These extended WMS capabilities can include more advanced capabilities, such as managing labor or optimizing the locating of inventory within a facility.
