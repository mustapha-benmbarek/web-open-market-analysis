# Enterprise Architecture Tools

EA tools help envision, model, and plan for the future of the enterprise, offering features to continuously evolve business, operating, and technology models. Heads of enterprise architecture should select an EA tool that supports enterprise-wide visibility, long-term transformation, and business-outcome realization.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the market for enterprise architecture (EA) tools as tools that allow users to capture interrelationships and interdependencies within and across an organization’s ecosystem of applications, capabilities, processes, operating models, roles, information and technologies. EA tools provide a central repository to capture data and metadata about artifacts that describe the enterprise. Users build models and viewpoints to represent the relationships between these artifacts, helping describe and shape the future of the enterprise. EA tools enable analysis of trends, disruptions, and other drivers of enterprise change to deliver realistic roadmaps and explore potential scenarios.

EA tools provide a means to model the IT and business aspects of the enterprise, in support of business outcome delivery. Doing so requires the collaboration of multiple stakeholders across the organization, with each playing a different role at a different time. The models and methods used by the stakeholders will vary depending on their role, and must be integrated and connected to other models to be useful.

To support these needs, EA tools have three aspects. The first aspect is the metamodel of the enterprise, reflecting the taxonomy and ontology of all elements (artifacts) that make up an enterprise, including their characteristics and relationships. The second aspect is the modeling environment, along with a supporting repository that reflects the instantiation of the metamodel. The third aspect is the facilitation of collaboration between a diverse group of stakeholders across the organization, from business to IT.

EA tools are utilized across a wide range of architecture and IT disciplines, such as business, information, solution, security, applications and infrastructure. EA tools provide detailed insights and support informed decision making by functioning effectively across various domains. To support an extensive range of stakeholders, EA tools must also facilitate the consumption of, and contribution to, the information contained within the repository. To perform their work, users switch between an expansive set of views and visual representations of the datasets contained in the repository.

EA tools are meta tools that require integration with a variety of enterprise systems, like configuration management databases (CMDBs), planning tools, financial management tools, and business process management (BPM) tools, to access and aggregate artifact data into meaningful insights. As such, EA tools’ success is highly dependent on data access, data quality and data governance of all systems it integrates with.
