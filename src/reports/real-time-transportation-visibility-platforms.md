# Real-Time Transportation Visibility Platforms

Real-time transportation visibility continues to be a key priority for shippers, logistics providers and their customers. Supply chain technology leaders can use this research to gain insight on current market trends and vendors in the real-time transportation visibility platform market.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the real-time transportation visibility platform (RTTVP) market as platforms that provide real-time location and status insights into orders once they have left the warehouse. This includes other facilities, such as those of a brand owner, supplier, contract manufacturer or service provider. Such platforms, owned and managed by third-party software vendors, represent part of the supply chain visibility market that predominantly — but not solely — addresses domestic road transportation modes. RTTVPs obtain data through integration (via API or electronic data interchange [EDI], for example) with carrier systems, direct feeds from telematics (in-cab or in-trailer devices) or other technologies or apps.

RTTVPs are used to gain near-real-time status and location of shipments in transit, along with predictive estimated times of arrival. This information can be used internally, as well as externally, to inform and update both types of customers related to shipments delays, estimated times of arrival (ETAs) and statuses. The use cases may vary based on the type of organization and the complexity of their transportation network.

Typical complexity levels or use cases are:

**Level 1 Complexity**: Level 1 RTTVP complexity applies to situations where companies need visibility in one region for only one mode of transportation.

**Level 2 Complexity**: Level 2 RTTVP complexity occurs when a company needs visibility to multiple modes managed from a single region.

**Level 3 Complexity**: Level 3 RTTVP complexity occurs when a company needs visibility in multiple regions across multiple modes.

**Level 4 Complexity**: At Level 4 RTTVP complexity, a company needs global visibility across all modes.

**Level 5 Complexity**: In Level 5 RTTVP complexity, companies are getting global visibility into all modes and utilizing all advanced capabilities within the platform.
