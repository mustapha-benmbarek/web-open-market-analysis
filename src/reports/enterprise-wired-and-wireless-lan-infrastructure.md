# Enterprise Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure

The need to reduce manual work in enterprise LANs is driving demand for AI networking and network as a service. As demand for automated and adaptive security grows, infrastructure and operations leaders should use this research to make investment decisions across campus, branch and remote locations.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the enterprise wired and wireless LAN infrastructure market as the hardware and software that enables local connectivity for users and devices. The infrastructure components include enterprise-class wired switches and wireless access points, and the management software that secures, manages, tests, optimizes and automates the network.

Organizations across vertical markets rely on enterprise wired and wireless network infrastructures to connect and transmit data for both fixed and mobile devices, enabling end users to access applications that are located either on-site, in remote private or public destinations. In addition to end-user connectivity, these infrastructures offer capabilities for diverse market needs, including:

- Discovery, identification, security, management and segmentation of Internet of Things (IoT) and operational technology (OT) devices.

- Design and planning for network infrastructure requirements.

- Implement zero-touch provisioning for deployment and configuration of the network infrastructure devices.

- Offer support, testing and maintenance for network infrastructure components

- Establish a resilient infrastructure to withstand disruptions and provide continuous operations.

- Implement robust security measures to safeguard the network infrastructure.

- Scalability and flexibility for efficient management and control plane communication processes.

- Provides a no-touch or low-touch environment for operations on Day 2.
