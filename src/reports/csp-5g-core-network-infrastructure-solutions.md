# CSP 5G Core Network Infrastructure Solutions

As 5G deployment shifts to stand-alone networks and cloud infrastructure, the 5G core market is evolving. Vendors offer innovative solutions with varied go-to-market strategies, leveraging AI, edge computing, and open APIs. Communications service provider CIOs can use this Magic Quadrant to assess 5G core providers.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines CSP 5G core network infrastructure solutions as a set of hardwares, software and services that form the intelligent control layer of the 5G network services. It enables communications service providers (CSPs) to deliver scalable, reliable, secure advanced connectivity and digital services to consumers and enterprise users. The 5G core is integral to a wide array of essential functions in the 5G network, encompassing access and mobility management, authentication, subscriber data management, policy control, network slicing and essential switching operations. This market covers CSPs’ deployment of 5G core solutions for the public 5G network.

A significant advancement from 4G evolved packet core (EPC), the 5G core network features service-based architecture and components like access and mobility management function (AMF), session management function (SMF) and authentication server function (AUSF), enabling better flexibility and efficient network management. It supports advanced functions like network slicing and effectively caters to diverse demands.

The use of 5G core offers multifaceted benefits, including enhanced connectivity, speed and personalized network performance. The most popular use cases include:

- Cloud-native design and service-based architecture (SBA), which offer enhanced flexibility and scalability, effectively catering to a wide range of users and devices, from individual consumers to small businesses and large enterprises.

- Network slicing, which helps create multiple virtual networks over a single physical and virtual infrastructure, allowing tailored connectivity solutions for diverse business needs, with different technical and commercial parameters including quality of service (QoS),latency and price, from emergency services to entertainment and industry-specific applications.

- Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) integration with the 5G core provides ultra reliable, low-latency services closer to the user to enable integrated communications and IT service.
