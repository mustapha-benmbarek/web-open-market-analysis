# Higher Education Student Information System Software as a Service

SaaS student information systems are evolving slowly, even as customer interest and vendor investments grow. Complex SIS transitions are impacted by changing business models, limited resources or cautious leadership. Higher education CIOs can use this research to evaluate and navigate in the market.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines student information system (SIS) software as a service (SaaS) as a core system of record for higher education institutions that serves as the central hub for storing, organizing and processing student academic and administrative activities. The SIS supports student, faculty and staff-facing functionality, including management of information assets, while also supporting back-end administrative functionality. SIS SaaS is delivered under apay-for-use basis or as a subscription license model (with regular updates), where application support and infrastructure provisioning and management are the responsibility of the vendor.

Serving the students, faculty and administrative staff, the SIS provides a chronology of business transactions, academic activity, advising interactions and educational outcomes. Additionally, it manages vital information assets, including course offerings, course catalogs, course registration, student accounts, financial aid, grades and transcripts throughout the student life cycle. The SIS may be part of a larger administrative ERP application suite and acritical component of an education institution’s larger digital technology platform.
