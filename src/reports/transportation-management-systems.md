# Transportation Management Systems

Transportation management systems help supply chain leaders manage disruptions and optimize costs. As requirements have changed and the TMS market has grown, the vendor landscape has become more crowded and complex. Supply chain technology leaders should use this research to evaluate the TMS market.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines transportation management systems (TMSs) as software that supports multimodal planning and execution of the physical transport of goods across the supply chain. It allows a shipper to manage varying levels of transportation complexity across multiple transport modes and geographic regions. TMS solutions are utilized by shippers of differing sizes, operational complexity, industries and geographic locations.

TMS solutions are utilized to plan and execute the physical transport of goods across the supply chain. They provide a shipper with the ability to manage the entire transportation lifecycle of an order or shipment. This includes:

- Sourcing and procuring transportation capacity from third-party companies by supporting bid management and optimization.
- Intaking orders to provide a shipment plan, including order and shipment consolidation, mode selection, routes and carrier selection.

- Taking the shipment plan and enabling communications with carriers to facilitate execution against the plan.

- Tracking and tracing the movements of shipments from pickup to final delivery.

- Matching expected transportation charges against actual charges to manage discrepancies.

- Making better transportation decisions by utilizing embedded analytics and reporting capabilities to measure key performance indicators, such as on-time performance, emissions calculations, and costs by customer, product line and location.

TMS solutions enable a shipper to have tighter control of their transportation operations, optimize costs, improve efficiencies, and have improved visibility into the movement of goods.
