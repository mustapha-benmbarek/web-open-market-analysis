# Access Management

Workforce AM vendors present unique and innovative features. CIAM vendors continue to offer differential capabilities for machine IAM support and enhanced capabilities to support complex CIAM and partner requirements. IAM leaders should focus on the features that differentiate vendors in this market.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines access management (AM) as tools that include authentication, authorization, single sign-on (SSO) and adaptive access capabilities for modern standards-based web applications, classic web applications and APIs.

AM’s purpose is to give people (employees, consumers and other users) and machines access to protected applications in a streamlined and consistent way that enhances the user experience. For people, SSO is part of the enhanced experience. AM is also responsible for providing security controls to protect the user session during runtime. It enforces authentication and runtime authorization using adaptive access. Lastly, AM can provide identity context for other cybersecurity tools and reliant applications to enable identity-first security.
