# Revenue Action Orchestration

Revenue action orchestration platforms are emerging as the cornerstone of AI-first sales execution. Sales operations leaders should evaluate RAO vendors based on their ability to deliver autonomous guidance, consolidate revenue signals and scale execution across complex go-to-market motions.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the revenue action orchestration (RAO) market as a category of technology vendors that use AI to improve sales productivity. Vendors capture revenue signals into one normalized data model, creating an AI-ready commercial dataset. RAO serves as the primary system of seller action and a single source of truth for sales interactions. For sellers, RAO facilitates AI-guided decision making and helps execute sales actions across multiple channels. For operations, RAO integrates AI into deal management, pipeline analytics and forecasting.

Traditional sales force automation (SFA) implementations often require sellers to invest time in administrative activities and don’t provide enough insight and guidance to materially boost productivity. Sellers commonly resist or otherwise fail to document deep intelligence uncovered during customer interactions and internal planning and research. Even when they do, limited data interoperability among sales systems prevents this data from being truly AI-ready.

For the seller, guidance provided by traditional SFA and sales engagement applications is often siloed by use case. For example, recommendations on deal execution, account planning and relationship management are informed by disconnected data sources and lack orchestration among commercial workflows. Additionally, the proliferation of these multiple applications within traditional user interfaces may actually increase seller burden, inhibiting adoption of new sales technologies.

For sales operations, traditional sales engagement solutions fail to help leaders design and distribute AI-guided actions that are novel, credible and suitably specific enough to benefit frontline seller productivity. When sellers are skeptical of the recommendations they receive, adoption is further inhibited.

For sales leadership, challenges with deriving insights from AI make it difficult to fully incorporate activity intelligence into their decision making. While traditional SFA and revenue intelligence solutions provide insights into pipeline health and sales forecasting, they often fall short on combining AI insights from a range of commercial use cases to offer interpretations, predictions and recommendations to sales leaders.

RAO applications address these challenges by:

- Logging and analyzing customer interactions, including emails, meetings, chats and web calls automatically.

- Providing AI-guided sales actions based on account characteristics and interaction history.

- Helping sellers create and send emails, make calls, and plan, conduct and transcribe meetings.

- Providing a seller action platform for managing AI-generated recommendations that serves as a primary system of action for multiple use cases.

- Offering programmable action orchestration for admins to define workflows and configure AI.

- Helping managers to navigate large volumes of data to coach sellers and submit forecasts.
