# Security Information and Event Management

SIEM technology will continue to evolve through multiple features and deployment models to deliver a security system of record with comprehensive threat detection, investigation and response capabilities. This research helps security and risk management leaders evaluate providers in this space.

## Market Definition

Security information and event management (SIEM) is a configurable system of record that collects, aggregates and analyzes security event data from on-premises and cloud environments. SIEM processes security event data for the purposes of threat detection, investigation and response. It natively supports data normalization and offers user-configurable detection content and reporting to orchestrate threat mitigation and satisfy compliance requirements. These solutions are delivered via a SaaS platform or client-hosted on-premises or private cloud.

The security information and event management (SIEM) system must assist with:

- Aggregating and normalizing data from various IT and operational technology (OT) environments.

- Designing and executing near real-time monitoring and alerting content.

- Enriching and investigating security events of interest.

- Supporting manual and automated response actions.

- Maintaining and reporting on current and historical event data.
