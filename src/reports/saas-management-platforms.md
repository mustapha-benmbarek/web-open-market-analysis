# SaaS Management Platforms

SaaS management platforms empower organizations to address the compounding challenges of SaaS application and generative AI usage across the business that lead to overspend, elevated risk, lack of visibility and contract sprawl. This research helps IT leaders identify suitable vendors.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines SaaS management platforms (SMPs) as software tools that aim to help organizations discover, manage, optimize and automate the SaaS application life cycle from one centralized console. Core SMP capabilities include discovery, cost optimization, employee self-service via an application store, insights to increase adoption and automation of onboarding/offboarding activities.

As SaaS adoption accelerates, IT leaders will struggle to discover and support SaaS-hosted applications in accordance with company, market or geographic policies and regulations. Increased SaaS costs — combined with limited visibility into the entire SaaS portfolio (including unapproved SaaS) and high levels of over deployed and under consumed licenses— result in significant financial, operational and cybersecurity risk.

SMPs help mitigate these risks and offer these benefits:

- Discovery and monitoring of approved and unapproved SaaS usage.

- Increased SaaS ROI due to providing data to help drive adoption.

- Improved management, forecasting and decision-making regarding SaaS contracts and renewals, as well as optimized costs and license entitlements.

- Enhanced employee experience via a curated self-service app catalog or store to find and request access to approved SaaS apps.

- Streamlined onboarding of new employees to existing SaaS apps and of new SaaS appsto the organization.

- Automated employee offboarding within SaaS applications.

- Reduced IT overhead with automation of configuration and policy management.

- Increased collaboration between teams that participate in the SaaS application life cycle, including all stakeholders internal and external to IT.

- Reduced risk with greater awareness of unapproved SaaS applications that are not integrated into corporate identity providers.

- Improved ability to comply with an increasing number of new regulations that require complete awareness of where company and customer data resides, as well as accelerated disclosure of potential breaches or vulnerabilities.

Common use cases include:

- <u>Discover</u>: Uncover sanctioned and unsanctioned SaaS use and costs, while balancing employee privacy.

- <u>Optimize</u>: Analysis, insights, alerting and automation to optimize SaaS costs and entitlement.

- <u>Enable</u>: Availability of an employee-facing application store or catalog to simplify SaaS requests, as well as analysis, insights and alerting to help drive SaaS adoption and maximize ROI.

- <u>Automate</u>: Simplify SaaS administration (request fulfilment, onboarding, offboarding, license reclamation, etc.) with customizable, template-based workflows.

- <u>Manage</u>: Management of configuration, policy, users and licenses via read/write API integration.

- <u>Comply</u>: Identification of SaaS applications and common certification details to determine compliance with industry regulations and organizational policy.
