# Revenue Enablement Platforms

This Magic Quadrant assesses top revenue enablement vendors as the market pivots to AI-driven, consolidated platforms. Trends include agentic AI, compliance, and ROI-focused outcomes. Use this research to identify vendors that align with your workflow, integration, and business impact priorities.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines revenue enablement platforms (REPs) as platforms that unite sales and customer-facing enablement and revenue functions. They encompass revenue-generating roles such as sales, customer success, marketing, partners and presales. They support both sales enablement and marketing leaders in providing a holistic enablement program. REPs are deployed as SaaS with mobile capabilities. The platforms have capabilities for digital content, learning, practice and coaching and engagement analytics as well as AI and conversational intelligence for skill building.

Revenue enablement platforms unify digital content management, learning, practice and coaching. They integrate with sales force automation (SFA) or marketing automation platforms, provide the ability to create and curate content focused to sales use cases and buyer journeys, feature buyer engagement analysis and measure content effectiveness. REPs drive effectiveness through behavior change resulting in improved revenue growth. They provide an organization the ability to control, focus and leverage its messaging delivered by revenue-facing roles to customers while gaining insight on customer and seller engagement with that content. They measure and build role skills and competencies through microlearning and retention quizzing, role-play practice and coaching, and analytics that improve commercial execution.
