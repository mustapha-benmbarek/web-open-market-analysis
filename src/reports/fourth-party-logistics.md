# Fourth-Party Logistics

This Magic Quadrant evaluates fourth-party logistics providers globally. Supply chain leaders responsible for logistics can use this research to assess these 4PLs when considering outsourcing their logistics and supply chain operations.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines fourth-party logistics (4PL) as a supply chain services provider that engages in the design, build, implementation and ongoing orchestration of all or part of the activities encompassed by an end-to-end logistics network. The 4PL coordinates and manages logistics operations via internal and/or external parties, delivering visibility, governance, control and optimization through integrated technology platforms.

Logistics leaders are looking to the 4PL market for a complete logistics outsourcing framework. This framework facilitates the integration of their logistics organization into the wider supply chain through the application of mainstream and advanced logistics technologies, capabilities and services offered by 4PL. Fourth-party logistics, as a supply chain integrator, provides access via a singular technology platform to integrate logistics systems across a complex network, offering unified visibility, data and operational control. 4PL offers logistics and supply chain services via a menu-based framework to diagnose, optimize, govern and orchestrate shipper networks as a relationship matures.
