# Network Detection and Response

Network detection and response platforms continuously monitor traffic for anomalies, suspicious patterns and threat indicators, and they complement other threat detection solutions. CIOs and CISOs can use this research to make informed decisions about NDR, which is evolving to offer broader threat detection.

## Market Definition

Network detection and response (NDR) products detect abnormal system behaviors by applying behavioral analytics to network traffic data. They continuously analyze raw network packets or traffic metadata within internal networks (east-west) and between internal and external networks (north-south). NDR products include automated responses, such as host containment or traffic blocking, directly or through integration with other cybersecurity tools. NDR can be delivered as a combination of hardware and software appliances for sensors, some with IaaS support. Management and orchestration consoles can be software or SaaS.

Organizations rely on NDR to detect and contain post breach activity such as ransomware, insider threats and lateral movements. NDR complements other technologies that primarily trigger alerts based on rules and signatures by building heuristic models of normal network behavior and detecting anomalies.

NDR is commonly used as a complementary detection and response technology as part of a broader arsenal of security operation center (SOC) tools. These include security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR), security information and event management (SIEM), endpoint detection and response (EDR), and other detection technologies, but also services such as managed detection and response (MDR).
