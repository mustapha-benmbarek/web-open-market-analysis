# Data Center Outsourcing Services

Data center outsourcing empowers organizations to delegate data center operations to expert third-party providers. This Magic Quadrant enables IT leaders to assess top vendors’ capabilities, ensuring secure, scalable, and cost-effective solutions aligned with business goals.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the data center outsourcing (DCO) services market as a comprehensive suite of services that support deployment, consolidation, optimization, modernization and managed services. These services primarily cater to data centers, private clouds, edge computing, ERP hosting, mainframes or legacy systems, midrange systems, infrastructure modernization, network and security. Organizations with such environments engage with DCO service providers to enhance efficiency, improve agility, optimize costs, strengthen security — physical, data and cyber — and realize substantial modernization benefits.

Data center outsourcing refers to the strategic decision by organizations to delegate datacenter operations to a third-party service provider. Adopting this approach assists organizations with prioritizing their core business activities while capitalizing on the advanced technologies, operational expertise, best-in-class performance metrics and cost-efficiencies offered by vendors, compared to insourced best efforts.
