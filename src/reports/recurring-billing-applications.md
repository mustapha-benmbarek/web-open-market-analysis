# Recurring Billing Applications

This Magic Quadrant evaluates 17 vendors that offer a cost-effective, modern, SaaS billing solution suitable for a wide range of industries.

## Market Definition

A recurring billing application enables organizations to bill customers for one-time, subscription-based and usage-based fees for goods and services. It consumes orders and/or service contracts documenting the goods and services the customer has purchased, periodically generates fixed recurring fees, and ingests and rates product usage data. It issues one-time or periodic roll-up invoices to the customer and collects payments before determining recognizable revenue and posting to an external general ledger. APIs or UI fragments support a self-service billing portal. Modern recurring billing applications are an important customer touchpoint for measuring customer sentiment and for delivering marketing messaging.

Recurring billing is mission-critical for invoicing customers and collecting revenue for a business. It ensures billing for all goods and services is aggregated into one periodic invoice to the customer. It enables value-based pricing models that are charged based on actual usage of the service. Payment can be automatically collected by a wide range of payment mechanisms. Dunning workflow optimizes the collection of failed or delinquent payments. Revenue recognition logic ensures adherence to the latest international standards such as IFRS 15 and ASC 606.
