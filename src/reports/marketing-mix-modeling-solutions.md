# Marketing Mix Modeling Solutions

CMOs continue to allocate large percentages of their marketing budgets to advertising, the results for which are especially difficult to measure. MMM solutions can illuminate the relationships between investments and outcomes and help CMOs map out pathways to improved efficiency and effectiveness.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines marketing mix modeling (MMM) solutions as services and software that help chief marketing officers (CMOs) plan future spend and measure past investment performance. MMM applies advanced statistical techniques to aggregate time-series data to quantify the holistic impact of marketing and optimize business outcomes such as sales or lead generation. MMM solutions acquire and normalize marketing data, build advanced statistical models based on that data, measure marketing performance, and deliver recommendations to improve spending effectiveness and efficiency. Results are delivered to marketers, media planners, and marketing and financial analysts via software and presentations.

Marketing mix modeling solutions quantify the holistic impact of marketing. They account for business factors (like inventory availability or physical footprint) and external factors (like consumer perception, competitive activities or macroeconomic conditions), and attribute that impact to different channels or campaigns. CMOs use MMM solutions for three primary use cases:

- Demonstrate marketing’s value by quantifying historical marketing performance while accounting for external factors.

- Enhance current marketing performance by optimizing existing media budgets, particularly for paid advertising.

- Improve long-term marketing performance by evaluating multiple scenarios for marketing budgets and external factors.
