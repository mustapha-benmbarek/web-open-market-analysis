# Process Mining Platforms

Process mining platforms give enterprise application leaders visibility and insights into their business processes and application landscapes, enabling them to make smarter decisions aligned to their organization’s priorities. We examine market forces and the leading vendors of platforms.

## Market Definition

Process mining platforms offer comprehensive analysis of end-to-end processes by extracting event data from information systems. This includes automated process discovery (extracting process models from an event log), conformance checking (monitoring deviations by comparing model and log), social network/organizational mining, automated construction of simulation models, model extension, model repair, case prediction and history-based recommendations. Process mining platforms extend process mining capabilities via advanced process analytics, process improvement detection and process improvement recommendations.

**Process discovery and analysis** — Process mining provides visibility and understanding of actual business operations and processes, resulting in unbiased, adaptable and maintainable process models. This extends to providing targeted insights on improving business operations and outcomes. Process mining enables business process analysts to create an updated business process repository that is used to analyze, streamline and redesign complex processes.

**Process conformance** — Process mining helps validate or audit whether actual execution of business processes are in conformance with internally defined compliance protocols, policies and best practices baked into enterprise applications, such as ERP and CRM. It also ensures the reliability of external financial reporting and compliance with external laws and regulations. Another variation of this use case is the comparison and analysis of the same processes across different business units, subsidiaries or even countries (comparative process mining).

**Enterprise application modernization** — Process mining enables enterprises to assess the impact of application modernization by uncovering the true state of operations. It provides insights into how changes in one application can create ripple effects throughout the application landscape. By visualizing interdependencies and identifying bottlenecks, process mining enables decision makers to understand the broader implications of modernization efforts, ensuring that updates lead to enhanced efficiency, reduced risks and alignment with strategic business goals.

**Discovering and validating automation opportunities** — Process mining helps business analysts discover and assess the opportunities for process automation. It effectively creates the business case for automation, which is difficult without actual process context. Process models are often used to configure enterprise applications and their integrated processes, such as ERP and CRM.

**Digital transformation** — After shifting the scope of process mining to the operational and organizational level, it is a small step to link these operational insights to big strategic initiatives like digital transformation or digital business. This growing use case is getting more attention because of the theme of digital business and, more recently, digital transformation.

**Discovering and validating agentic AI opportunities** — As business processes are unique to enterprises, generic agentic AI capabilities would neither be scalable nor maintainable. Process mining enables enterprises to create and validate their custom agentic AI requirements against their true state of business operations.
