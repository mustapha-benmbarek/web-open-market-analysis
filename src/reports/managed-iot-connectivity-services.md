# Managed IoT Connectivity Services

Enhanced by data analytics and AI, managed IoT connectivity services simplify sourcing and integration with IoT devices, edge platforms, and cloud services across regions. CIOs can use this research to evaluate global managed IoT connectivity service providers for IoT-enabled businesses.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines managed IoT connectivity services as a market that enables secured connectivity, data collection, analysis and additional decision services. Managed Io connectivity services are delivered fully managed, including dedicated help desk and project and service management capabilities, although hybrid managed and self-managed could also apply as delivery models. Self-managed is delivered through a self-service Io connectivity management portal, including Level 2 and Level 3 back-office support.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices can use various connectivity technologies. Connections can be cellular (2G, 3G, 4G/LTE and 5G); satellite, low-power wide-area (LPWA) networks (3GPP and non-3GPP); and managed field-area networks (FANs). Managed IoT connectivity services also enable organizations to securely collect, analyze and interact with data streams, therefore providing businesses with the ability to monitor, manage and control (manually and through automation) assets associated with business processes. This includes connected consumer, commercial or industrial products.

Additionally, managed IoT connectivity services may encompass integrated and managed IT infrastructure and systems, operational technology (OT) infrastructure and systems, software, network services (connectivity), and IT services. Managed IoT connectivity services are a solution element within the broader solution sets of digital businesses and OT systems in enterprise environments.
