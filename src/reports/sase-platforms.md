# SASE Platforms

The SASE platform market is evolving as more vendors enter the market and offerings mature. Still, there is differentiation in vendor capabilities and strategies. I&O leaders responsible for networking and cybersecurity should use this research to help determine the right vendor for their needs.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines single-vendor secure access service edge (SASE) offerings as those that deliver multiple converged-network and security-as-a-service capabilities, such as software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN), secure web gateway (SWG), cloud access security broker (CASB), network firewalling and zero trust network access (ZTNA). These offerings use a cloud-centric architecture and are delivered by one vendor.

SASE securely connects users and devices with applications. It supports branch office, remote worker and on-premises general internet security, private application access and cloud service consumption use cases.
