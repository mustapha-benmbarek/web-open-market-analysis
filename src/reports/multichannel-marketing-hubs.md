# Multichannel Marketing Hubs

In 2025, AI and unified data are fuelling significant change in multichannel marketing hubs. CMOs must weigh new opportunities for impact against ongoing uncertainty and risks. Use this research to inform profitable, competitive strategies and guide martech investment decisions.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines multichannel marketing hubs (MMHs) as software applications, primarily delivered as SaaS, that orchestrate personalized campaigns and event-driven customer journeys across marketing channels. These applications leverage customer data, predictive models and real-time insights to optimize the timing, channel and content of interactions. MMHs apply advanced analytics, AI and prescriptive intelligence to help marketing and technical teams manage the end-to-end life cycle of customer journeys. Although MMHs overlap with customer data platforms (CDPs) and personalization engines, their primary focus is enabling marketing users to manage large-scale consumer interactions, particularly in owned media channels such as email and app push.

Multichannel marketing hubs empower marketers to deliver personalized media and orchestrate customer journeys, thus driving revenue, engagement and loyalty. These SaaS applications unify customer data, predictive insights and real-time decision making to optimize interactions across digital channels. MMHs enable multidisciplinary teams to manage campaigns and event-driven journeys via advanced analytics, artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and prescriptive intelligence.

As AI and generative AI (GenAI) technologies evolve, MMHs are helping teams dramatically expand the number, variety and quality of customer journeys, enabling greater personalization at scale. Advanced capabilities, such as campaign ideation, allow marketers to collaborate with AI agents to quickly produce near-complete journeys, including: Campaign briefs, Audience segmentation, Multistep journey design, Media channels, Personalized content coded for individual channels

By automating these traditionally human-bound tasks and pairing them with prescriptive journey optimization, MMHs enable marketers to focus on strategy, creativity, efficient production, and innovative practices or experiences.

Buyers value MMHs for their ability to orchestrate multichannel experiences and accelerate time to market. Organizations increasingly favor MMHs that: ease journey maintenance by optimizing underperforming journeys and speed journey development by identifying audience segments or designing and coding media.

These emerging capabilities enhance agility and performance, helping marketers stay competitive and increasing the tool’s value to the organization.
