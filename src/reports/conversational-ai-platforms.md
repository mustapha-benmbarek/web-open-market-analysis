# Conversational AI Platforms

The conversational AI platform market is evolving, with use cases expanding to include conversational AI agents and tools increasingly leveraging generative AI. This report guides application leaders in selecting conversational AI platforms for complex automation and multimodal interactions.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines conversational AI platforms (CAIPs) as SaaS products that primarily enable the development of applications simulating human conversation across multiple channels and media. CAIPs leverage composite AI, including generative AI (GenAI) and natural language technologies. Conversations can use a mix of modalities such as text, voice and visual content. To support the building of conversational applications, platforms provide extensive coding options, from pro-code to no-code. Application areas include chatbots, virtual assistants (VAs) and conversational AI (CAI) agents.

CAIPs are used to create, deploy and manage AI-driven conversational interfaces. These platforms enable businesses to develop VAs and conversational AI Agents that facilitate both customer-facing and internal interactions through pro-code/low-code/no-code tools.

CAIPs empower businesses to centralize and democratize the development and management of multiple, diverse CAI initiatives, leading to more cohesive and efficient operations. The blend of capabilities provided by CAIPs is distinctive compared to those offered by other CAI solutions, such as targeted extensions for CAI found in other enterprise applications (e.g., CRM systems, contact center platforms) or stand-alone GenAI-native apps. In comparison, CAIPs are a better fit for strategic and scalable enterprise-grade CAI adoption.
