# Financial Planning Software

Financial planning software supports FP&A transformation through integrated, intelligent and continuous planning, leveraging AI, IBP and connected data. CFOs can use this research to identify vendors that best align with their process and planning requirements.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines financial planning software (FPS) as the key tool that enables data-driven financial resource allocation, investment and spending decisions by supporting effective planning, budgeting and forecasting processes. FPS enables organizations to link their strategies to financial and operational plans through cloud-based software. It facilitates the creation and management of financial plans, budgets and forecasts by breaking down information silos and integrating operational KPIs. FPS analytics and reporting features offer a holistic performance view, connecting both operational (nonfinancial) and financial metrics, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

The objective for CFOs and their teams is to provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to financial management by addressing the complexity of modern business environments, use of diverse data sources and need for real-time insights. FPS enables finance teams to manage and execute planning processes with a centralized application that supports data integration, data modeling, workflow and reporting capabilities. Finance teams typically leverage these solutions to address three key business challenges: Improving overall planning processes, supporting broader organizational decisions and enhancing overall effectiveness. They do so by integrating information from operation and financial sources. These solutions improve the planning process, optimize resource allocation and generate reliable financial statements by connecting operational and driver data to profit and loss, balance sheet and cash-flow statements, benefiting both internal management and external stakeholders.
