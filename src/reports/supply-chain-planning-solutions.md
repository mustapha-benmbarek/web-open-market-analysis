# Supply Chain Planning Solutions

Supply chain planning technology is required to provide responsiveness, agility and flexibility in support of a company’s strategic goals. This Magic Quadrant will help supply chain technology leaders evaluate and select the most suitable software vendors to develop their SCP technologies.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines supply chain planning (SCP) solutions as platforms that provide technological support to enable a company to manage, link, align, collaborate and share its planning data across an extended supply chain. An SCP solution supports planning, ranging from demand planning through detailed supply-side response planning, and from strategic planning to execution-level planning. It is the planning decision repository for a defined end-to-end supply chain. It is also the environment in which end-to-end-integrated supply chain decisions are managed. It establishes a single version of the truth for planning data and decisions, regardless of the underlying execution technology environment.

Organizations use SCP solutions to improve their supply chain planning decisions and reach higher levels of maturity. These solutions enable and streamline planning decision making by providing access to planning data, application of logic, such as business rules, and priorities and process governance capabilities. If utilized optimally, this results in improved end-to-end supply chain planning processes, including aligning strategic priorities with resource allocations to drive improved business outcomes.

The common use-case scenarios or business problems SCP solutions are intended to address include:

- **Aligning plans end to end —** This involves creating plans that are aligned and feasible across all the different tiers in our supply chains, from suppliers to customers and further tiers out. It is also focused on creating plans that are connected across the different planning layers, from strategic-level planning to execution-level planning.

- **Improving visibility —** This involves providing insights into the status of the supply chain as well as key metrics used for decision making. By having information readily available, organizations are better equipped to assess and provide actionable insights based on data. Users can identify areas where improvements can be made to increase efficiency and drive value creation for the organization.

- **Fostering decision-making speed and quality —** This involves meeting the need for faster and higher-quality decision making for the supply chain operations. By having strong technology support, automation of processes and decisions can be enabled, resulting in higher efficiency and less human-biased decision making. Collaboration capabilities allow planners to collaborate directly in the platforms, resulting in greater confidence in the inputs and outputs used to make decisions.
