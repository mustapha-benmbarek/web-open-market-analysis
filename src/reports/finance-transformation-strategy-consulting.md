# Finance Transformation Strategy Consulting

A well-defined finance transformation strategy is essential for shaping strategic objectives and roadmaps that align data, delivery models, talent, technology and process enhancements. CFOs can use this research to identify service providers that offer strategic insights and help build future-ready finance operating models.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the finance transformation strategy consulting market as services that assist CFOs and their finance organizations in crafting strategies and finance transformation roadmaps for various business-aligned, forward-looking initiatives. These engagements use dedicated external finance subject matter experts and transformation delivery assets with the aim of increasing the value that finance provides to the organization, while maximizing functional efficiency through appropriate organizational design, data, people, technology and process improvements. This market differs from finance transformation implementation consulting, which helps CFOs enhance operations and management practices through project delivery capabilities in areas like process improvement and technology implementation.

CFOs face increasing complexity in their finance transformation ambitions, requiring diverse external strategy support. They must evaluate improvement opportunities across finance’s data, delivery models, processes, technology and people to effectively prioritize and integrate the most impactful innovation opportunities into their finance transformation strategies.

Finance transformation strategy consulting engagements provide critical support to CFOs through several key activities:

- Conduct thorough research to uncover and cultivate transformative ideas that reshape CFOs’ perspectives on the future of their finance operations, ensuring they remain at the forefront of function advancements.

- Perform detailed assessments to identify discrepancies between current performance levels and optimal outcomes within the finance organization, enabling targeted improvements.

- Develop a strategic roadmap that delineates the optimal finance function’s operations to ensure maximal organizational value.

- Provide guidance on the selection, prioritization and sequencing of finance transformation initiatives.

- Deliver tailored executive briefings, incorporating change management support, that align with the specific objectives and constraints of the client’s organization, facilitating smooth transitions and adaptations.
