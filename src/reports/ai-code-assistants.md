# AI Code Assistants

The AI code assistant market continues to burn hot as rapid innovation and intense competition is fueled by disruptive advances and new entrants. Use this research to compare vendors, navigate key trends, and select the right AI code assistant to enhance developer productivity, foster creativity, and enable robust, contextual software development workflows.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines AI code assistants as tools that generate and analyze software code and configuration. They use foundation models like LLMs, program-understanding technology, or both. Developers engage with these assistants to generate, analyze, debug, test, fix, refactor code, search dependencies, update libraries, create documentation, understand code, upgrade versions, translate languages and review commits. They help developers learn and explore codebases and access related information, such as frameworks and tools. AI code assistants integrate with developer environments, code editors, command-line terminals, chat interfaces, project management tools, monitoring, logging and deployment tools. Some are customized to an organization’s specific codebase and documentation.

AI code assistants enhance software developers’ experience by boosting their efficiency, accelerating application development, minimizing cognitive overload, amplifying their problem-solving skills, enabling faster learning, fostering creativity and maintaining their state of flow.
