# Digital Experience Monitoring

DEM tools monitor the availability and performance of modern and legacy applications to gauge the end-user experience of employees and customers. Heads of I&O can use this Magic Quadrant to shortlist DEM vendors.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines digital experience monitoring (DEM) as the measurement of the availability, performance and quality of the user experience of applications. This can include internal users (employees), external users (customers and partners) or a digital agent connecting to an API. In addition to performance, DEM enables observability of user behavior and journeys based on their interaction with applications.

DEM tools allow I&O leaders to understand the availability, performance and reliability of business applications, networks and infrastructure by focusing on understanding the user experience. This is in contrast to other performance monitoring approaches, such as observability platforms, that understand the inner workings of applications.

“User” is defined broadly for DEM tools and may include internal and external users or even digital agents. Use-case examples include understanding the performance and availability of:

- Employees accessing applications critical to their role (e.g., intranet, CRM website)

- Outsourced third-party applications/services where there is no way to directly instrument the outsourced environment

- Customers accessing a commercial website (e.g., retail or online banking application)

- Digital agents connecting to important APIs, ensuring the availability and performance of critical digital components

DEM tools also:

- Help enterprises proactively identify application performance degradation from a user’s point of view

- Understand user behavior and journeys within the application

- Help track important applications’ SLAs

- Enable benchmarking of application performance and issue identification before users are affected (e.g., before and after component upgrade)

- Provide data to help identify the best opportunities to improve website performance

While DEM tools are useful in understanding customer behavior, they differ from customer experience analytics tools in that the primary focus is on measuring the impact of application performance on customers/users. Tools that focus primarily on customer experience are not included in this market.

DEM tools also differ from digital employee experience management (DEX) tools, as DEM focuses more broadly on digital experience for customers or employees, and infrastructure components. DEX focuses exclusively on the digital experience of employees through their company-provided physical and virtual endpoints accessing approved applications and services. DEX incorporates organizational and employee sentiment data, and acts to resolve identified issues. Solutions offering endpoint-only monitoring, or those that focus on or are only provided within security or vendor VPN implementations, are excluded from this research.
