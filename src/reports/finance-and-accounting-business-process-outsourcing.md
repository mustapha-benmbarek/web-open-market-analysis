# Finance and Accounting Business Process Outsourcing

Outsourcing has become a crucial element in CFOs’ playbook for cost reduction and efficiency amid global disruption. This research helps CFOs assess F&A BPO providers’ capabilities to deploy process automation and intelligent workflows that lead to reduced processing costs and enhanced efficiency.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines finance and accounting (F&A) business process outsourcing (BPO) as the use of third-party outsourcing service providers to handle transactional finance processes such as purchase-to-pay, order-to-cash and record-to-report. BPO service providers remotely connect to clients’ systems to carry out these operations. BPO service providers can also offer proprietary or partnered process automation solutions to enhance transactional processing efficiency. F&A BPO services are typically delivered from global delivery centers.

F&A BPO providers offer processing services and process automation solutions for purchase to pay (P2P), order to cash (O2C) and record to report (R2R). Providers offer processing and automation services to improve P2P, O2C and R2R processes, which offer buyers the ability to purchase process transformation expertise and process automation technologies to help their finance operations mature.

At minimum, an F&A BPO provider processes finance activities via a remote connection to its customers’ existing systems. Providers offer the required staff, located in global delivery services, to deliver these services. Cost savings and efficiency gains are passed on to the buyer in the form of labor arbitrage.

Enhanced F&A BPO offerings that meet finance’s need for more automated transactional processing focus on providing process transformation expertise, often combined with proprietary or partnered process automation technologies, including the use of AI and machine learning. Buyers benefit from these types of agreements by maturing their processes, adopting technologies that require minimum human intervention, and driving more competitive processing costs.
