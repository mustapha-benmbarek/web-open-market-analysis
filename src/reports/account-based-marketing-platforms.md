This research helps demand generation leaders evaluate ABM platforms to enable better decision making, improve engagement across accounts and deliver measurable value.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines account-based marketing (ABM) platforms as software that enables B2Bmarketing and sales teams to run ABM programs at scale, including account discovery and selection, planning, engagement and reporting.

To support this effort, ABM platforms offer capabilities to engage audiences by activating channels such as: **Display advertising and retargeting, Social advertising, Email, Personalized webpages, Sales engagement**.
