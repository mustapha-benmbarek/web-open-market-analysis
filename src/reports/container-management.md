# Container Management

Container management solutions are evolving to meet more challenging use cases. Heads of I&O must navigate this market to find vendors that support agility, security, modernization and transformation initiatives.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines container management as off erings that support the deployment andoperation of containerized workloads. It uses a combination of technologies (many opensource) that enable agile application deployments and infrastructure modernization. Delivery methods include stand-alone software or as a service.

Container management automates the provisioning, operation and life cycle management of containerized workloads at scale. Centralized governance and security policies are used to manage container workloads and associated resources. Container management supports the requirements of modern applications (also refactoring legacy applications), including platform engineering, cloud management and continuous integration/continuous delivery(CI/CD) pipelines. Benefits include improved agility, elasticity and access to innovation.
