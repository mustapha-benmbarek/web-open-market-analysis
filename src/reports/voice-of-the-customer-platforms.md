# Voice of the Customer Platforms

Organizations use VoC platforms to manage the customer experience through a deep understanding of customer needs and perceptions. This research helps you identify vendors whose VoC platforms are best equipped to help them achieve their CX and business objectives.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines a voice of the customer (VoC) platform as one that integrates feedback collection, analysis and action into a single interconnected platform that helps understand and improve the customer experience. Sources of feedback extend beyond direct surveying to include other, more indirect and inferred sources.

VoC platforms enable leaders responsible for functions such as customer service, marketing, or sales to better manage the customer experience (CX) through a deep understanding of customer needs, motivations, goals and behaviors. The resulting insights trigger recommendations and actions across the enterprise.

Common use cases include:

**VoC data sources are surveys only:** This scenario involves independently running annual or regular customer satisfaction surveys, with little to no collection of indirect or inferred feedback from customers. Data is often not shared across the organization.

**VoC data sources include indirect feedback:** This scenario involves the integration of direct customer feedback with indirect feedback, such as text analytics, social media analytics and speech analytics. Data is centralized/shared and analyzed more holistically.

**VoC data sources extend to inferred feedback:** This scenario involves the integration of direct and indirect customer feedback to include inferred data. Data may include digital analytics, customer journey analytics and operations data to get a more holistic view of the customer.

**VoC data is disseminated and embedded:** This scenario centers on disseminating relevant and real-time data via workflows, reports and dashboards while embedding this VoC data into frequently used applications such as CRMs.

**VoC insights impact business outcomes:** This scenario focuses on the ability to quantify resulting actions from VoC insights with their impact on CX and business outcomes.
