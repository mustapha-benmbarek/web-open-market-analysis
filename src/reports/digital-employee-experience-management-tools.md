# Digital Employee Experience Management Tools

The ability to measure and continually improve the digital employee experience using technology, employee sentiment and organizational data is critical for a thriving digital workplace. This research helps IT leaders responsible for DEX select the right tool vendor.

## Market Definition

Digital employee experience management tools measure and help IT continuously improve employee sentiment toward and the performance of company-provided technology. They continuously surface actionable insights, drive self-healing automations, and optimize support and employee engagement via the near-real-time processing of aggregated data from endpoints, applications, employee sentiment and organizational context. These insights enable self-healing and can enhance employee interactions with self-service portals and chatbots. They also help IT support, asset management, procurement and other teams whose work depends on reliable information.

DEX tools help IT improve the digital employee experience by quickly identifying and remediating technology issues. Benefits for IT teams include greater visibility of device and application performance, reliability and usage; reduced overhead through automation; and improved endpoint configuration and patch compliance. Benefits for the workforce include reduced digital friction that impedes productivity, the ability to offer feedback, faster issue resolution, and rightsized virtual and physical endpoints with optimized life spans.

Common use cases include:

- Discovering and remediating configuration drift from company, vertical industry or regulatory standards.

- Measuring and improving application adoption and reliability.

- Improving sustainability and reducing spend by transitioning from scheduled to performance-based refresh cycles.

- Reducing security risk and improving patching compliance by identifying and remediating the cause of missing patches, which endpoint management or patching tools often cannot identify or self-heal.

- Ensuring readiness for OS upgrades inclusive of reliability, capacity, performance, configuration and requirements checks.

- Establishing digital personas based on technology usage data to create technology bundles, simplifying and accelerating employee onboarding.
