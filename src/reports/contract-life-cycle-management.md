# Contract Life Cycle Management

Organizations are pursuing cross-functional CLM strategies, leading to new investment or replacement of current CLM solutions that don’t meet their enterprise requirements. Procurement technology leaders can use this research to understand the vendor landscape and select a suitable CLM vendor.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines contract life cycle management (CLM) market as a solution that proactively manages contracts from initiation through negotiation, execution, compliance and renewal. In this context, a contract is any agreement or contractual document containing rights and obligations that affect an organization now or in the future (e.g., a nondisclosure agreement).

CLM solutions allow organizations to create, negotiate and store contracts in a centralized repository. Using these solutions helps mitigate organizational risk by enabling regulatory and policy compliance, providing governance over what is signed and with whom, and role-based access to terms and obligations with third parties. CLM solutions drive visibility, consistency and efficiency in the contracting process across an enterprise. Use cases are primarily aligned to parts of the process, such as pre signature and post signature. Different departments often prioritize a certain use case based on their involvement in the contracting process.
