# Personalization Engines

Personalization is a top strategy for differentiating customer experiences. It can improve CX, increase revenue, boost customer satisfaction and reduce cost through operational efficiencies. The personalization engine market revenue grew 21% in 2023and has a projected CAGR of 23.8% through 2027.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines personalization engines as technology that enables marketing professionals to identify, set up, conduct and measure the optimum experience for an individual based on knowledge about them, their intent and context.

Personalization engines apply context about individual users and their circumstances to select, tailor and deliver messaging such as content, offers and other interactions through various digital channels in support of three use cases:

- **Marketing**: Delivering the right message to the right audience and in the right context(i.e., tone, timing and channel) to maximize marketing and advertising performance. It involves behavioral inference, segmentation, testing, targeting and optimization of marketing campaign content, messaging and engagements across marketing and communication channels.

- **Digital commerce**: Tailoring content, offers, recommendations and experiences across digital sales channels. It includes personalized site search and navigation and customized content across homepages, category landing pages and product detail pages, with the goal of increasing conversion and delivering online revenue growth.

- **Service and support**: Using customer insight, journey context and user feedback (i.e., surveys and stated intent) to customize online and offline experiences across business functions to reduce customer effort or increase customer satisfaction and advocacy.
