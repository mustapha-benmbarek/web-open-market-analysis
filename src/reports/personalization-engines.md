# Personalization Engines

Personalization differentiates the customer experience, driving revenue and efficiency. The market grew 26.1% in 2024 to $1.2B, yet business and functional capability gaps remain. Successful digital marketing leaders closely examine AI and testing capabilities while being wary of possible add-ons.

## Market Definition

Personalization engines use knowledge about customers to create and deliver an optimum experience for them and measure the impact on customer experience. These engines apply AI, advanced analytics and business rules to create meaningful experiences across channels that facilitate customer engagement and drive revenue.

Personalization engines create a relevant, individualized interaction between two parties designed to enhance the recipient’s experience. A recipient can be a prospect, customer (known or anonymous) or employee (engaging with a customer or prospect). In commercial settings, the engines apply advanced analytics to interpret customer data — whether known or anonymous, behavioral or contextual — and adjust engagement based on where the customer is in their journey and how they’re interacting. The engines adapt content, offers and interactions in real time that facilitate the customer’s journey.

These engines are commonly used in marketing, digital commerce, and service and support:

- In marketing, they drive engagement by delivering relevant messages to the right audience at the right time and through the right channel.

- In digital commerce, they facilitate purchasing by providing meaningful content, tailored product recommendations and targeted promotional offers.

- In service and support, they enhance customer experiences by addressing needs and preferences with personalized assistance.

Personalization can range from broad targeting to highly individualized engagement, depending on what is known about the customer and how they’re interacting. This leads to stronger engagement, higher acceptance of recommendations, improved conversion, higher average order value, and reduced bounce and abandonment.
