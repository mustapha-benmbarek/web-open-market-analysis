# Digital Experience Services

Digital experience service providers implement DX technology platforms to design, build, and enhance user experiences for both internal and external stakeholders. This Magic Quadrant assesses 17 providers with capabilities in delivering end-to-end DX services for organizations’ advisory, implementation, and continuous optimization needs.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines digital experience (DX) services as those services that design, deliver and optimize digital experiences across customer, employee and citizen journeys using technology solutions. The services involve design, solution implementation, content management services, marketing services and ongoing operations. The digital experience solution is delivered through a combination of technologies and services working together to deliver the desired experience outcomes.

Digital experience services are focused on creating the optimal user experience, to better sell to, market to, inform and manage the target user (customer, partner, citizen or employee). The services include advisory on what the experience should be, implementation services to create the experience, and operational services to evolve and manage the ongoing experience. These services are not just technical services, but also include creative, content and marketing operations, historically served by digital marketing agencies but now offered by a range of providers, including consulting firms, systems integrators (SIs) and agencies.

Buyers of digital experience services will engage with service providers for one or more of the following use cases.

**Experience design:** This use case supports the buying organization in defining their brand, product and service experience strategy, marketing strategy, content strategy, customer growth strategy, new product/service launch, technology strategy, and their information and service architectures.

**Experience solution implementation:** This use case supports the client organization in implementing, migrating, composing, creating and developing digital experience solutions using a platform or a combination of products.

**Experience solution operation and evolution:** This use case includes services that are focused on keeping the already-implemented experience solution current through technical evolution services, ongoing content and creative services, and marketing services.

**Content and creative services:** This use case supports the creation and management of digital experiences for the purpose of collaboration, communication, commerce and marketing.

**Marketing services:** This use case supports the digital marketing and advertising operations of client products and services.
