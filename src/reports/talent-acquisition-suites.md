# Talent Acquisition (Recruiting) Suites

Talent acquisition suites play a crucial role in helping to manage the growing demand Talent suites for talent, which is resulting from evolving business requirements and a dynamic labor market. HR recruiting leaders can use this Magic Quadrant for guidance in addressing hiring needs through technology.

## Market Definition

Talent acquisition (recruiting) suites are used by recruiting teams to manage the job application selection process. Capabilities include an applicant tracking system, which handles the job requisition, job posting, application, and candidate selection workflows, and a combination of candidate relationship management (also known as sourcing or pipelining) and/or employee onboarding modules. Today’s talent acquisition suites offer a variety of talent suites functions with an emphasis on automation and AI-enabled capabilities to provide a streamlined, engaging experience for all stakeholders involved in the hiring process, such as recruiters, hiring managers and candidates.

Organizations that do their own hiring require a means to engage, select and onboard would-be employees.

**Applicant Tracking System (ATS):**
ATS allows recruitment teams to improve operational efficiency by automating workflows for job requisitions, collecting, assessing and interviewing job applicants (screening), as well as extending and signing job offers. They also serve to enhance the applicant’s experience through the hiring process by providing enhanced career portals and streamlining recruiter-applicant communications. As the “core” of a talent acquisition (TA) suite, the ATS may include additional features such as candidate matching and interview scheduling, or these features may be acquired through the vendors’ third-party partnerships with point solution specialists. Partnerships are also typically required for assessment and background checking needs.

**Candidate Relationship Management (CRM):**
When a TA suite includes CRM capabilities, its purpose is to identify and continuously engage potential candidates for future job openings. Ready-now talent pools or candidate pipelines provide a competitive advantage to an organization. CRM features include the ability to send personalized marketing campaigns to maintain a connection with your talent pools until the right job opportunity is available. These capabilities can be an integral part of the sourcing and engagement stage of recruitment.

**Employee Onboarding:**
When a TA suite includes employee onboarding capabilities, its purpose is to automate the transactional data collection and compliance paperwork necessary to support pre-hire activities leading up to the first day of work, as well as sometimes the first 30/60/90+ days of new-hire readiness. This is intended to accelerate a new joiner's speed to productivity. Features also include the delivery of engaging content to reinforce a new joiner's decision to join the organization and begin relationship building. Onboarding typically begins at the conclusion of the selection process and commonly integrates with an organization’s core HR, payroll, learning management and case management systems.
