# Banking Payment Hub Platforms

This Magic Quadrant assesses global banking payment hub platforms based on market position and strategies aligned with crucial trends such as composable architecture, ISO 20022, real-time processing and AI. Bank CIOs can use this research to select a platform meeting their medium- and long-term payment processing requirements.

## Market Definition

A banking payment hub is a configurable platform that enables financial institutions to centrally process incoming and outgoing payments. Banking payment hubs are deployed with a software-only on-premises model or in the cloud as software only, software as a service (SaaS), or payments as a service (PaaS). They have three layers: an input layer, a processing layer and an output layer.

A banking payment hub provides payment processing for financial institutions, such as banks or credit unions. It centralizes payment processing, which reduces the effort to comply with payment regulations. Thus, financial institutions can reduce the effort to support periodic scheme updates required by settlement authorities.

A banking payment hub is integrated with multiple back-end and front-end (that is, customer-facing) solutions. It removes silos created by legacy banking systems that separately generated their own payments. This facilitates innovation at financial institutions by centrally introducing new payment methods, such as real-time payments or blockchain payments, instead of each banking product doing it independently.

A payment hub architecture has three layers:

**Input layer —** This layer accepts a payment request for an incoming or outgoing payment and performs basic validation, such as checking whether the debit account, credit account, currency and amount are valid. If the payment request is not in a format that the payment hub can process, or the accounts are not processed by the payment hub, then the request can be rejected or corrected.

**Processing layer —** Once the payment request has been accepted, it is processed in the processing layer. Processing includes reachability checks, routing of payment, duplicate payment check and balance check. The processing layer will also calculate fees and charges, calculate the date the payment will be processed, and call external systems for fraud and sanctions checking.

**Output layer —** The output layer formats outgoing payment messages and sends them to the central settlement authority. When the payment is between two accounts at the same bank, the output could create an account transfer, rather than generate an outgoing payment message. The output layer generates the accounting entries — for example, outgoing payments will debit the payer account and credit the nostro account.
