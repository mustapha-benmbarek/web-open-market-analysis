# SaaS P&C Insurance Core Platforms, North America

Declining deal volumes, disparities in R&D strategy, AI use cases and pricing make vendor selection complex for these long-term investments. CIOs can use this research to identify platforms that best align with their goals for innovation, resilience and differentiation.

## Market Definition

Software as a service (SaaS) property and casualty (P&C) insurance core platforms enable insurers to support the administration of a range of P&C insurance products. They provide full product life cycle support by offering functionality, applications, services and content in a secure, cloud-based environment, offered as a service using subscription pricing. Theyencompass a single predefined and marketed core solution, either as a suite of pre integrated modules or a single application, supporting policy administration, billing and claims management. They also incorporate additional components to deliver customer, employee or partner experiences; data and analytics; integrations; and access to third-party technology solutions.

SaaS P&C insurance core platforms enable P&C insurance companies to manage and administer the entire life cycle of insurance policies and scope of products. They are mission-critical systems for insurance companies, foundational for digital optimization and enablers for digital transformation.

Depending on the vendor, core and noncore modules can be purchased and implemented separately or as a suite of tightly coupled modules in the cloud. In addition, a core system typically integrates with other information systems, such as general ledgers, CRM, payment gateways, data lakes and third-party data sources, to support the end-to-end operations of the insurer.
