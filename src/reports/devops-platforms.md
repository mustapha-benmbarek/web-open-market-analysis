# DevOps Platforms

DevOps platforms provide software engineering teams with an integrated set of capabilities that improve developer experience across the SDLC and enable teams to rapidly deliver software. This research evaluates DevOps platform vendors to help leaders make buying decisions.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines DevOps platforms as those that provide fully integrated and orchestrated capabilities to enable continuous delivery of software using agile and DevOps practices. The capabilities span the development and delivery life cycle built around the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, including planning, creation, artifact management, security, quality engineering, change management, compliance, environment management, deployment and monitoring. DevOps platforms support team collaboration, consistency, tool simplification and measurement of software delivery metrics. They are delivered primarily as cloud-hosted services with some options for on-premises deployment.

DevOps platforms simplify the creation, maintenance and management of the components required for the delivery of various types of modern software. Platforms create common workflows and data models, simplify user access, provide production-like development and test environments, and provide a consistent user experience (UX) to reduce cognitive load. They lead to improved visibility, auditability and traceability for the software delivery value stream. This end-to-end view encourages a systems-thinking mindset and accelerates feedback loops.

Organizations use DevOps platforms to minimize tool friction resulting from complex toolchains, manual handoffs and lack of consistent visibility throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC). This enables product teams to deliver faster customer value without compromising quality. The DevOps platforms market reflects the consolidation of technologies across development, security, infrastructure and operations to streamline software delivery.

DevOps platforms support multiple use cases, including, but not limited to:

- Agile software delivery — Operationalize agile development practices.

- Cloud-native application delivery — Build and deliver cloud-native applications across hybrid and multicloud environments.

- GitOps — Support the operation of applications using declarative constructs stored in Gitin a closed-loop, automated system.

- MLOps — Provide support for the management of machine learning (ML) models including versioning and feedback loops.

- Platform engineering — Provide self-service, internal developer platforms to scale DevOps and software engineering practices.

- Regulated delivery — Support for compliance, auditing, traceability and governance.
