# AI-Augmented Software Testing Tools

AI-augmented software testing tools are context-aware, data-driven and increasingly autonomous tools that enable software engineering leaders to deliver higher-quality products faster. Use our evaluation of AI-augmented software testing vendors to select the best fit for your organization.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines AI-augmented software testing tools as tools that provide fully integrated and orchestrated capabilities to enable continuous, self-optimizing and highly autonomous testing in the software development life cycle (SDLC) through the use of AI. Capabilities include the generation and maintenance of test scenarios, test cases, test automation, test suite optimization, test prioritization, test analysis, and test value scoring. As part of the larger toolset for AI-augmented development that aids software engineers in designing, coding and testing applications, AI-augmented software testing tools integrate with AI code assistants, chat interfaces, DevOps platforms, planning and deployment tools. They are delivered primarily as cloud-hosted services with some options for on-premises deployment.

AI-augmented software testing tools are designed to simplify and accelerate the creation, maintenance and management of test artifacts throughout the SDLC. They help software engineering teams to increase the efficiency, effectiveness and fidelity of tests by reducing human intervention. Teams can build confidence in the quality of their release candidates and support software engineering leaders in making informed decisions regarding product releases.

Organizations use AI-augmented software testing tools to reduce the dependency on manual testing or hard-to-maintain test automation, minimize manual handoffs, and provide consistent visibility throughout the software testing life cycle. By simplifying the testing process and abstracting the complexities associated with interacting with the system undertest, AI-augmented software testing tools enable product teams to deliver customer value faster.

The market for AI-augmented software testing tools reflects the rapid evolution of technologies for efficient generation, maintenance, tracking, versioning, selection and prioritization of test artifacts; running tests at scale in the cloud; and optimizing the overall test process. These tools are intended to be more than just a tool for authoring and running tests; they are essential for businesses aiming to achieve excellence in software quality, productivity and market responsiveness.
