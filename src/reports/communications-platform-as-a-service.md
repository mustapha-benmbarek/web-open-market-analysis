# Communications Platform as a Service

CPaaS providers offer cloud-based platforms for developers and other business roles to build communication workflows that digitally operationalize customer engagement and experiences via APIs, SDKs, visual builders and AI. CIOs can use this Magic Quadrant to evaluate providers.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines communications platform as a service (CPaaS) as a cloud-based platform used by developers, the IT team and other nontechnical business roles to build an array of communications-related capabilities using APIs, SDKs, documentation and no-code/low-code visual builders. The CPaaS tools facilitate access to multiple communications channels spanning voice, SMS, email, messaging apps, video and conversational capabilities, along with security.

The purpose of CPaaS is to enable enterprises to improve communications workflows by providing simplified access to multiple communications capabilities.

CPaaS enables enterprises to shorten time to market for new products and services, personalize communications, and orchestrate customer journeys across multiple channels. It delivers digital engagement and operationalizes customer experience, while also driving business efficiencies at scale with digital service delivery. It is modular/composable in design and can expand from initial single use cases to many others as additional business units learn of its value.
