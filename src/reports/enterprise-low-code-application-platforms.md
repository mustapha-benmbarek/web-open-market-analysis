# Enterprise Low-Code Application Platforms

Software engineering teams struggle with delivery speed, legacy complexity and integration demands. Enterprise LCAPs address these challenges by streamlining development with AI-assisted tooling, composable architectures and built-in governance to accelerate secure, scalable application delivery.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines enterprise low-code application platforms (LCAPs) as software platforms for the accelerated development and maintenance of applications, using model-driven development tools, generative AI and prebuilt component catalogs for the entire applicationâ€™s technology stack. Enterprise LCAP features include support for the collaborative development of all application components; runtime environments for high performance, availability and scalability of applications; and application deployment and monitoring with detailed usage insights. Enterprise LCAP platforms feature governance controls and insights, self-service capabilities, APIs for integration with external DevOps tooling, success management with exhaustive technical documentation, training programs and a comprehensive global partner network.

Enterprise LCAPs provide the foundation for developing a wide range of applications and application components with distributed data architectures, including complex multimodal front ends, business workflows, agentic AI and integration capabilities.

The enterprise LCAP market is closely related to the citizen application development platform (CADP) market, as they both aim to address the use cases listed below. However, they are distinctively different in terms of the target audience and complexity of the applications built on the platform.

The most popular use cases include:

- **Line-of-business software development for both back- and front-office applications.** Enterprise LCAPs can scale from small businesses to global enterprises. They can handle any use case if business and technology stakeholders formulate requirements that account for the strengths and weaknesses of the low-code/no-code abstractions.

- **Modernization and augmentation of legacy business applications.** Replacing legacy applications or extending their functionality is usually an expensive, lengthy and risky undertaking. Enterprise LCAPs aim to accelerate the delivery of new implementations, improve cost controls and better mitigate the risks associated with modernization initiatives.

- **Development of applications to support internal company processes and digital workplaces.** Enterprise LCAPs can also be used outside IT departments with moderate IT supervision and governance to tackle simple and narrow use cases for internal company process automation, reporting, data visualization and simple integration scenarios.
