## Market Definition

Gartner defines content marketing platforms (CMPs) as software solutions that support the end-to-end content production process. These solutions facilitate creating and curating text, video, images, graphics, audio, e-books, white papers and interactive content assets that are distributed through paid and owned channels. These assets are used to tell connected stories that help brands engage with and nurture multiple audiences with content that drives awareness, demand, purchases and loyalty.

CMPs enable the fundamentals of content marketing — specifically, content strategy, editorial planning, creative workflow, distribution and performance measurement — to drive a coordinated approach and standardized production process at scale.

CMPs collect and analyze data to inform content creation and reuse, streamline operations and iterate on content to improve marketing effectiveness. These platforms can also generate branded iterations of content for different audiences using artificial intelligence and human creators. They enable internal teams, external contributors and agencies involved in content creation to coordinate efforts across projects and campaigns.

As a result, CMPs help connect content marketing efforts to business objectives across channels, ensuring organizational alignment and broad scope for managing content. CMPs also drive iterative content improvements, including capabilities to evaluate and test operating models and governance
to drive collaboration across siloed teams. This supports faster time to market at scale.

Many CMP vendors complement their software with optional services, such as content strategy development, editorial services, creative marketplaces, and training to driveadoption and utilization.
