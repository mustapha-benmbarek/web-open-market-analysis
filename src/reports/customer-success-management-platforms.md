# Customer Success Management Platforms

Customer success management is a crucial function for B2B organizations with recurring revenue streams. This Magic Quadrant evaluates vendors offering a CSM platform that can guide customers to value, provide visibility into customer health and scale the customer success practice.

## Market Definition

Customer success management (CSM) platforms are AI-enabled SaaS solutions used by B2Borganizations selling subscription-based solutions to guide life cycle interactions and provide visibility into account health. CSM platforms help customer success and account-facing teams to achieve customer retention, growth and value realization objectives. They provide the ability to define and execute playbooks and automate customer outreach based on triggers or specific journey stages. Using data ingested from internal and external sources, these platforms can provide customer health alerts and suggest or automate next best actions. These platforms also provide capabilities for managing and resourcing the customer success function.

Businesses that offer high-value products and/or services, often sold through subscription models, are using CSM programs to retain and grow revenue from existing accounts. Customer success management is the business discipline of guiding customers to realize value through product adoption or service utilization across the owning life cycle. It uses a data-driven approach to monitor customer health and engagement and uncover insights that drive proactive and prescriptive action leading the customer to derive value, renew, expand and advocate. CSM platforms are necessary to scale the function, providing oversight and insight into team performance and the hundreds or thousands of accounts at various life cycle stages.

CSM platforms provide capabilities to create a holistic view of the customer, guide customers through their onboarding and owning journey, and surface customer health indicators in a way that provides actionable insights to all stakeholders. They also provide capabilities for managing the function, including customer segmentation, account assignments and planning, individual activity and performance, pipeline management and revenue forecasting.

To provide more transparency and predictability in achieving customer renewal and growth targets, CSM platforms support the following use cases:

- **Self-contained customer success teams:** This scenario is for customer success teams that support a small number of products and users.

- **Enterprise customer success functions:** This scenario is composed of large and distributed teams supporting a robust product portfolio.

- **Integrated customer success and service offerings:** This scenario is for monetized customer success offerings that can be bundled with premium support, customer education and/or professional services.
