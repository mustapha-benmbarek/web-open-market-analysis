# AI Applications in IT Service Management

Artificial intelligence applications in IT service management are tools that use AI to augment and extend ITSM workflows to provide intelligent advice and actions for I&O leaders and their IT support teams. This Magic Quadrant evaluates 10 vendors and their AI-enabled products in this market.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines artificial intelligence applications in IT service management as tools that augment and extend IT service management (ITSM) workflows using AI. These analyze ITSM data and metadata (primarily found in ITSM platforms) to provide intelligent advice and actions on ITSM practices and workflows, such as IT service desk and support activities. This software can either be a stand-alone product, capabilities within an ITSM platform or an add-on to an ITSM platform.

I&O leaders are challenged by rising costs of support, and declining employee engagement and productivity.

AI capabilities enable I&O teams to optimize IT support and service management processes (such as incident and problem management) through insight and automation. This can lead to tangible reduction in costs, such as labor savings by handling support issues and requests automatically, faster resolutions, and improved accuracy in triage, categorization and expert identification. In addition to addressing overheads, AI solutions can improve the employee-facing user experience and enhance IT’s relationship with the business consumer. Some features, such as intelligent risk advisory, can help I&O leaders avoid disruptions and provide reliable IT services.

Generative AI capabilities are increasingly sought-after to automate content generation and improve communications. Examples include summarizing information, such as knowledgebase articles or case work log updates, and generating major incident notifications.

The Use-Case Prism: Artificial Intelligence for IT Service Desk provides further details on the AI and generative AI opportunities that tools such as AI applications for ITSM are able to address.
