# Business Orchestration and Automation Technologies

Business orchestration and automation technology platforms unify process orchestration, connectivity and agentic features to enable enterprise-wide automation. This Magic Quadrant assesses 20 BOAT vendors to help guide your business process automation decisions.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines business orchestration and automation technologies (BOAT) as a consolidated software platform that delivers enterprise process automation by enabling capabilities including orchestration of business processes, enterprise connectivity, low code development and agentic automation. A BOAT platform includes a cross section of certain capabilities from different markets such as business process automation (BPA), low-code application platforms (LCAP), integration platform as a service (iPaaS), intelligent document processing (IDP), robotic process automation (RPA), collaborative workflow management, and document management. However, this list is not necessarily all-encompassing.

A BOAT platform would be suitable for those who are looking for a consolidated platform that can address an interconnected portfolio of capabilities instead of a range of disparate tools. Such a platform should be used to address a wide range of business process automation use cases within the enterprise, such as:

- Case management.
- Complex and long-running workflows (e.g., straight-through processing).
- Autonomous or semiautonomous tasks powered by AI agents.
- Automation of simple, routine human tasks.
- Extraction and processing of semi structured and unstructured data.

Customers typically looking to buy or blend instead of custom-building a solution may prefer a BOAT platform. Organizations might also end up with more than one BOAT platform, depending on their needs.
