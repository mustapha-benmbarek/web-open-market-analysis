# Intranet Packaged Solutions

Intranets are one of the few technology investments that have widespread influence on employee experience, productivity and community building. Enterprise application leaders should use this analysis to navigate the IPS market, and determine suitable options that meet business needs.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines an intranet packaged solution (IPS) as a general-purpose, unified, multichannel software product available via public or private cloud deployment. It delivers a versatile range of business-to-employee digital experiences, including internal communications, community and social interaction, knowledge bases, self-service functions, and access to training and business applications. IPS products utilize web and mobile channels to support these experiences, while also offering native support for other channels such as email, AI assistants, digital signage, in-app plugins and messaging apps. The web channel may consist of a single site or a collection of IPS-created sites, encompassing various site types such as portals, “front doors” or hubs. An IPS is typically sponsored by HR and internal communication leaders as part of digital workplace initiatives.

An IPS aims to provide consistent digital experiences that help employees perform their best work, connect to the organization’s culture, align with the organization’s strategy, and advance their skills and expertise. It facilitates the creation, deployment, management and evolution of multichannel communications, serving as a common resource for information and knowledge sharing across the organization. Deploying an IPS enhances the effectiveness and efficiency of intranet projects.

IPS products are used for business-to-employee use cases, empowering stakeholders —such as communications, HR, CIOs and digital workplace leaders — to coordinate efforts that require both business and technical expertise. An IPS supports employees in a wide range of roles and contexts — including both office and frontline (or “deskless”) workers.

Key use cases addressed by IPS products include:

- Improving employee engagement and facilitating corporate communications

- Providing access to employee and workplace services

- Delivering a unified resource portal

- Enabling knowledge services for business areas

- Enabling better personal and teamwork management

- Promoting diverse intelligence assistance options

IPSs empower business technologists and citizen developers to extend the IPS.

A “packaged solution” signifies a holistic fit-for-purpose employee intranet approach. This excludes custom-built intranets, intranet products that require developers to build the solution, digital experience platforms used primarily for external needs, on-premises intranet solutions, or those solutions lacking core features in their offering. Products dependent on the purchase of other intranet products are not an IPS.
