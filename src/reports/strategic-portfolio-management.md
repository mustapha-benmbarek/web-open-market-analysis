# Strategic Portfolio Management

Strategic portfolio management technologies integrate various portfolio structures to model alternative paths to successful business outcomes. This research helps portfolio management leaders focused on digital investments identify vendors dedicated to increasing SPM effectiveness with technology.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the strategic portfolio management (SPM) market as comprising both cloud-based and on-premises applications for enterprise wide strategic planning and execution, supporting advanced portfolio management. SPM offerings integrate multiple portfolios with interdependent structures, creating a dynamic model of the path to realize strategic outcomes. These products are ideally suited for organizations pursuing digital strategies, which demand extensive stakeholder collaboration to continually adapt to changing conditions.

Organizations use SPM to align portfolios with strategy and apply value-based decision making for ongoing flexibility in the midst of progress, disruptions and opportunities. Digital strategies combine portfolios representing different contexts, such as business capabilities, investments, applications, services, assets, programs, products and projects. Strategists, business leaders, IT leaders and PMOs cooperatively align the utilization of these diverse portfolios to progressively achieve strategic objectives. SPM technology is beneficial in the pursuit of digital business outcomes as it helps navigate complexity while balancing the following fundamental constraints:

- Limited funding to invest.

- Expected value of opportunities.

- Availability of people with necessary skills to perform work.

- Enterprise IT needs for business capabilities.

- Time required to accomplish strategic goals.

SPM technology offerings enable organizations to effectively engage stakeholders to conduct strategic planning and execution. It supports the following key use cases:

- **Strategy execution management**: The projected value generated through planned execution is compared with defined measurable goals. This process allows for adaptation to enhance business outcomes. SPM enables ongoing assessment of progress, forecasts and dynamic conditions to evaluate alternative courses of action that improve goal realization.

- **Enterprise program and portfolio management**: SPM optimizes the utilization of funding, people and other resources managed in portfolios, empowering enterprise wide stakeholders to achieve goals. Portfolio governance is performed in alignment with strategy to distribute accountability for results. Continual monitoring and analysis support collaboration to adapt plans for better outcomes.

- **Integrated IT portfolio analysis**: The progressive transition of IT to support the future state of digital business is managed through distinct portfolios. The various IT elements that are modified and built to help achieve business outcomes are interdependent. SPM enhances the planning and execution of strategies by integrating enterprise IT and investment considerations.
