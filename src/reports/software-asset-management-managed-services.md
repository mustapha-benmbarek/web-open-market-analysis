# Software Asset Management Managed Services

IT skills shortages and rising software/cloud complexity are driving up IT spend. In response, sourcing, procurement and vendor management leaders are turning to SAMand FinOps managed services for support. Use this research to identify providers that address your organization’s specific needs.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines software asset management (SAM) managed services as services that expert providers deliver to manage the software, SaaS and cloud assets of end-user organizations. Their delivery includes skills, processes, technologies and governance to transform and run the SAM discipline on behalf of the client.

SAM managed services employ the providers’ proprietary skills and methodologies to transform and run SAM and FinOps disciplines on behalf of the client, augmenting the client’s resources. Delivered by skilled resources and leveraging the provider’s expertise, intellectual property (IP), rigor and best practices, SAM managed services address the gap in available SAM and FinOps skills, enable scalability and enhance maturity. At the same time, they deliver day-to-day SAM and FinOps activities and oversee the full life cycle. SAM managed services are delivered directly to end-user customers, on either a continuous or a project basis, employing required discipline to meet software and cloud cost optimization, and governance objectives.
