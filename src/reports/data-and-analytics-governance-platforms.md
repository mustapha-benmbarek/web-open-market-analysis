# Data and Analytics Governance Platforms

A data and analytics governance platform helps organizations design and enforce governance policies for data and its derived assets across its life cycle. D&A leaders should explore and adopt these capabilities to meet end users’ demand for streamlined, scaled, and automated governance decision making.

## Market Definition

A data and analytics governance platform is a set of integrated business and technology capabilities that help business leaders and users develop and manage a diverse set of governance policies and enforce those policies across business and data management systems. These platforms are unique from data management in that data management focuses on policy execution, whereas D&A platforms are used primarily by business roles —not only or even specifically IT roles — for policy management.

Data and analytics (D&A) leaders who are investing in operationalizing and automating of D&A governance should evaluate this market. The work of D&A governance primarily includes policy setting and policy enforcement, and collaborates with data management (policy execution). Use cases are employed across numerous governance policy categories and multiple business scenarios and asset types (data, KPIs, analytics models). The intersection of use-case/business scenarios, policy categories and assets to be governed is then used to identify the technology capability. These capabilities may share similar names across policy categories, but may not mean the same thing, or may be used differently by various governance personas.
For example, data classification in a data security implementation would be quite different from a data classification effort for creating trust models, which would be based on lineage and curation.
