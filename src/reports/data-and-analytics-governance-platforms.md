# Data and Analytics Governance Platforms

A data and analytics governance platform will help business and tech leaders to design, implement and monitor governance policies. As end users increasingly demand the simplification and unification offered by this emerging platform, D&A leaders should explore and adopt these capabilities to meet their evolving needs.

## Market Definition

A data and analytics governance platform is a set of integrated business and technology capabilities that help business leaders and users to develop and deploy a diverse set of governance policies and monitor and enforce those policies across their organizations’ business systems. These platforms are unique from data management in that data management focuses on policy execution, whereas these platforms are used primarily by business roles — not only or even specifically IT roles.

Data and analytics leaders who are investing in operationalizing and automating the work of data and analytics governance should evaluate this market. The work of data and analytics governance includes policy setting and policy enforcement, and excludes data management (policy execution). Use cases are employed across numerous governance policy categories and multiple business scenarios. The intersection of use-case and policy categories is then used to identify the technology capability. These capabilities may share similar names across policy categories, but may not mean the same thing. For example, data classification in a data security implementation would be quite different from a data classification effort in a master data management implementation, yet both markets and the vendors in them use the same terminology.
