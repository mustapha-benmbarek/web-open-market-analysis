# Marketing Work Management Platforms

MWM platform adoption is widespread, but productivity gains remain limited. With vendors integrating on-platform AI assist features, CMOs who enforce standardized usage across teams and stakeholders can significantly enhance capacity and business outcomes.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines marketing work management (MWM) platforms as a self-service system of record for marketing projects and productivity. MWM platforms provide a holistic view into past, current and planned work and enable the optimization of resources applied to marketing initiatives. MWM platforms offer intake management, resource allocation, project orchestration, operational performance measurement and workflow automation, and more. Native or integrated tools may enable varying degrees of strategic, financial and talent planning.

MWM platforms are deployed by marketing operations leaders to:

- Centralize the documentation of work requests and align initiatives to strategy.

- Scope and route work to appropriate resources using templates based on type, tier and complexity.

- Estimate the value and prioritize the order of work execution based on parameters determined by the business.

- Standardize the execution of work across internal teams and external agencies.

- Track work progress, budget expenditures and resource utilization over time.

- Assure compliance with regulatory, legal and privacy standards as defined by the enterprise and in a manner that simplifies review and approval of work.
