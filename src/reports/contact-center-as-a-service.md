# Contact Center as a Service

The CCaaS market continues to grow, yet buyers face increasing uncertainty from the emergence of generative and agentic AI, and the impending convergence with CRMCEC solutions. This research helps customer service and support technology leaders find the best-fit providers for their needs.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines contact center as a service (CCaaS) as solutions offering SaaS-based applications that enable customer service departments to manage multichannel customer interactions holistically from both a customer-experience and employee-experience perspective.

CCaaS is a key technology platform used to support the customer service experience, whether it be self-service or assisted by customer service representatives. All organizations need to offer customer assistance. The preference is for remote support via voice and digital channels over physical presence in offices and stores, though it is common for organizations to offer multiple options.

The ambition is for customers to self-serve assistance, through web portals or chatbots. Butit is also recognized that complex issues still need the support of employees. CCaaS technology is instrumental in orchestrating both self- and assisted-service engagement with customers. The technology can also manage the quality of engagement between the customer and the customer service representative, recognizing that premium customer experiences are achieved through premium employee experiences.
