# Security Service Edge

Security service edge is a dynamic market that consolidates multiple access-related point offerings into a single cloud-centric converged offering. This Magic Quadrant will help buyers evaluate key vendors ideally in the context of a SASE strategy.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines security service edge (SSE) as an offering that secures access to the web, cloud services and private applications regardless of the location of the user, the device they are using or where that application is hosted. SSE protects users from malicious and inappropriate content on the web and provides enhanced security and visibility for the SaaS and private applications accessed by end users.

Security service edge provides a primarily cloud-delivered solution to control access from end users and devices to applications, as well as websites and the internet. It provides a range of security capabilities, including adaptive access based on identity and context, malware protection, data security and threat prevention, as well as the associated analytics and visibility. It enables more direct connectivity for hybrid users by reducing latency and providing the potential for improved user experience. Capabilities that are integrated across multiple traffic types and destinations allow a more seamless experience for both users and administrators while maintaining a consistent security stance.
