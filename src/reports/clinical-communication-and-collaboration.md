# Clinical Communication and Collaboration

Clinical communication and collaboration systems enhance care team effectiveness, optimize nursing operations and reduce toil. Healthcare provider CIOs and clinical leaders should use this research to assess vendors’ foundational and differentiating capabilities.

## Market Definition

Clinical communication and collaboration (CC&C) systems are mobile platforms that clinicians, care teams, patients and caregivers use to collaborate on treatment and care activities within ambulatory, acute, postacute and virtual care settings. CC&C systems improve situational awareness surrounding the patient and information sharing at the point of care and during care transitions. CC&C systems represent the convergence of conventional inpatient communications, such as telephony and paging, with modern channels enabled by mobility, interoperability and the Internet of Things (IoT).

CC&C solutions facilitate communication and collaboration among physicians, nurses, support staff and health system services. CC&C care teams increasingly include patients, caregivers and family members, making CC&C a viable tool for patient and family engagement and virtual care. CC&C can positively affect care outcomes, patient safety, care team efficiency, clinician productivity and morale, care coordination, and patient throughput and capacity management.

CC&C systems represent the convergence of conventional communication channels (such as telephony and paging) with modern devices and technologies (such as smartphones, secure chat, text messaging and video). Real-time and responsive care collaboration approaches are vital at the point of care and during care transitions. They are essential to satisfy increased consumer and patient expectations and key care quality measures that affect the organization’s reputation and revenue goals.

CC&C systems improve operational efficiency by incorporating patient data in systems, such as patient flow, bed management, location services and resource scheduling systems (such as on-call, physician or nursing). CC&C solutions are part of an emerging care team collaboration ecosystem, including interactive patient care, nurse call, resource scheduling systems, and alarms and notifications middleware.

Common CC&C use cases include:

- Accessing and viewing critical patient results
- Collaborating with care team members in real-time
- Engaging the patient and caregiver in care and treatment
- Enhancing the patient experience and reducing care team toil
- Improving patient safety and care quality measures
- Participating in virtual care encounters
- Managing medical device alarms and notifications
- Optimizing care handoffs and transition
