# 4G and 5G Private Mobile Network Services

The emerging 4G and 5G private network services market includes vendors with varying capabilities in geographical reach, multivendor support, orchestration, and industry-vertical focus. This research helps CIOs evaluate providers for their global 4Gand 5G private mobile network service needs.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines 4G and 5G private mobile network (PMN) services as private wireless network deployment, operation and management services for the exclusive use by a given organization, to provide dedicated connectivity for people and assets of an enterprise setting. 4G and 5G PMN services are delivered as an end-to-end service that covers design, architecting, deployment and management, based on the 3GPP standards, in a specific enterprise location, with dedicated or a mix of shared assets, such as spectrum or core network.

Enterprises deploy PMNs for wireless connectivity in enterprise locations such as factories, warehouses, ports, airports and mines to provide:

- Better reliability than other wireless options.

- Greater independence on technology direction and decisions versus public network.

- Data privacy which enables better surface attack management.

- Isolation from public cellular networks, stronger authentication than Wi-Fi.

- Consolidation of multiple existing connectivity technologies into one PMN.

- Data collection and analysis, and additional decision services that are necessary for connected solutions and industrial applications.

- Easier scalability for number of endpoints and use cases, and multiple sites.

- Seamless handover and national roaming to public mobile network.

- High-throughput use cases, such as computer vision.
