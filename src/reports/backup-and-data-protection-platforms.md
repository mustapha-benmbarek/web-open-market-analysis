# Backup and Data Protection Platforms

Backup and data protection platforms vendors are continually enhancing their backup offerings to improve enterprise data protection across multicloud, SaaS and datacenter environments. Heads of I&O should use this research to identify and select vendors to address their enterprise data protection needs.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines backup and data protection platforms as technologies that capture point-in-time copies of enterprise data for the purpose of recovering it from multiple data loss scenarios, enhancing data protection initiatives, and expanding data insights and access capabilities. These technologies protect enterprise data, applications and infrastructure in hybrid, multicloud and SaaS environments. Backup and data protection platforms are available as software-only integrated appliances and vendor-developed and hosted backupas a service (BaaS).

Protecting and recovering an organization’s application data, regardless of the underlying infrastructure type and its location, are more important than ever. As enterprises operate in more complex environments, backup and data protection platform solutions protect
enterprise data, whether they reside in hybrid, multicloud or SaaS environments.

These solutions are vital to organizations’ ability to recover data following events that cause it to become inaccessible. Whether such an event is accidental or due to hardware or software failure, operational errors, malicious attacks or environmental incidents, organizations use these solutions to reliably recover and restore access to the affected data accurately and efficiently.

Solutions must offer effective capabilities to simplify the management of data protection across increasingly complex and diverse environments. This includes capabilities to test, expedite and orchestrate data recovery responses for both traditional disaster andcyberevents.

Solutions also extend beyond traditional recovery use cases to drive further business valuefrom the data that is copied to the platform. It incorporates use cases that are focused on data-driven enablement, such as enhanced data protection and infrastructure integrations and expanded data insights and access.

Enhanced protection capabilities include application discovery, enhanced cyber-recovery readiness capabilities, orchestration of disaster and cyber-recovery testing and processes, data discovery and access tracking. Integrations extend to bidirectional operational insight swith other infrastructure and operations platforms, such as networking, storage and security.

Data insights and access capabilities enable vendor solutions to present data to newpersonas beyond the backup administrators.New personas include additional IT personas such as security, DevOps, and data and analytics, as well as other business users such as compliance and legal.
