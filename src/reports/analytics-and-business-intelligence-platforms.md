# Analytics and Business Intelligence Platforms

Data and analytics leaders use ABI platforms to support the needs of IT, analysts and consumers. While integration with cloud ecosystems and business applications is a keyselection requirement, platforms should also enable governance, interoperability and AI to automate the analytics process.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines analytics and business intelligence platforms (ABI) as those that enable organizations to model, analyze and visualize data to support informed decision making and value creation. These platforms facilitate the preparation of data and the creation of interactive dashboards, reports and visualizations to uncover patterns, predict trends andoptimize operations. By doing so, they empower users to collaborate and effectively communicate the dimensions and measures that drive their organization. The platforms may also optionally include the ability to create, modify or enrich a semantic model, including business rules.

Analytics and business intelligence platforms integrate data from multiple sources, such as databases, spreadsheets, cloud services and external data feeds, to provide a unified view of data, breaking down silos and transforming raw data into meaningful insights. They also allow users to clean, transform and prepare data for analysis, in addition to creating data models that define relationships between different data entities.

For more than 20 years, visual-exploration-based dashboards and reports have been the primary way users monitor and explore data. However, time spent in curated, predefined dashboards will be complemented and even displaced partially by automated, conversational and dynamically generated insights. Modern ABI platforms are increasingly leveraging generative AI (GenAI) to enhance productivity for both developers and consumers of analytics content by augmenting the data-to-insight workflow through low- and no-code features. For developers, GenAI features include creating metrics, models, visualizations, reports and dashboards; for consumers, it focuses on extracting insights and meaning from data to support informed decision making.
