# CRM Customer Engagement Center

CRM customer engagement centers are unified AI-augmented customer service technology suites offering customer interaction orchestration and service process orchestration. Customer service and support technology leaders can use this Magic Quadrant to find the solution that best fits their needs.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the CRM customer engagement center (CEC) as a cohesive set of software built around core case management tools, dedicated to providing customer service and support by engaging with customers, and intelligently orchestrating the processes, data, systems, and resources of an organization.

CRM CEC is a key software platform used in delivering end-to-end customer service and support experiences. It enables customers to engage and interact with an organization as well as for the organization to orchestrate its internal and external processes and resources to fulfil the customer’s expected outcome.

Organizations focused on delivering their customers’ expected outcomes when they engage with a service request, find that it typically requires the activation of multiple parts of the organization. Delivering such outcomes, with minimum effort on the part of the customer, is enabled by technology tools which must seamlessly work in conjunction until the expected customer outcome is fulfilled. These technology tools fall into two main categories:

- External facing tools that enable the customer interaction

- Internal tools that enable the orchestration of various service processes, customer records, systems, data, and other organizational resources. In addition to customer service agents and supervisors, CX designers, business analysts, data analysts, solution developers, senior business leaders, etc. can also use these internal tools.

CRM CEC solutions are instrumental in providing these two types of tools that work together seamlessly as a holistic, unified solution to deliver customer outcomes through self- and assisted service.
