# Service Integration and Management Services

Cloud computing, AI and automation are reshaping IT services, driving organizations to outsource SIAM to streamline operations and reduce complexity. Sourcing, procurement and vendor management leaders can use this research to evaluate the execution and strategic vision of global SIAM providers.

## Market Definition

SIAM refers to the provision of technology consulting, project implementation and operational management services across IT and business process service providers, internally and externally. These services coordinate, integrate service delivery and align service management processes. SIAM aims to achieve seamless end-to-end service outcomes with a single point of accountability in a multi sourced IT services environment. SIAM services can be delivered internally; however, we cater to SIAM functions delivered by external SIAM providers. SIAM is typically used in multi sourced infrastructure and application outsourcing initiatives. It also applies to business process outsourcing (BPO) and can integrate other business functions, like finance and HR.

Consumers of service integration and management (SIAM) who want to achieve seam less end-to-end service outcomes from the SIAM provider relinquish the responsibility of managing service delivery quality, resulting in a hybrid IT services ecosystem.

A SIAM provider is usually a third party contracted by an organization to act as its agent for governing and managing services and sources. This operates in an environment that uses a neutral third party (internal and external) for IT and business process services delivery. The SIAM provider has a direct contractual relationship with the organization, rather than with the external sources engaged (as it would under a prime or general contractor arrangement).

The outcome of SIAM may vary from organization to organization but should focus on at least the following:

- Improved delivery excellence and operational efficiency.
- End-to-end governance.
- Improved experience.
- Improved service velocity.
- Better alignment with business outcomes.
- Transparent and centralized reporting, and monitoring of all IT service delivery.
- Improved and accurate asset and configuration management.
- Improved change management outcomes.
- Clear and actionable root cause analyses (RCAs).
