# Collaborative Work Management

Collaborative work management platforms improve planning, resource management, and teamwork, driving operational efficiency, strategic alignment, and governance in today’s digital workplace. This Magic Quadrant evaluates vendors in this space and highlights key market trends, including AI-powered automation, contextual collaboration, and real-time insights.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines the collaborative work management (CWM) market as the market for stand-alone software tools that provide task-driven workspaces to enable end users to plan, coordinate and automate their work. These tools provide an integrated assembly of user-friendly capabilities for work planning, in-context collaboration, content collaboration, workflow and automation, reporting, analysis and dashboarding, intelligent assistance, anduse-case acceleration on a platform that handles data management and administrative operations. Tools are defined by their purpose (work planning and execution), target users and breadth of functionality.

CWM tools empower business users to:

- **Plan work activities** by breaking them into tasks, establishing task dependencies, and specifying timelines, resources or budgets.

- **Collaborate with peers** in activity team spaces to create and share relevant documentation, update plans based on new information, send or receive notifications, and discuss status or next steps.

- **Automate repetitive activities** by means of workflows or rules that trigger actions automatically, based on events and execution activity.

- **Observe work activity continuously** by means of dynamic, customizable, operational and management-level reports, and dashboards.

- **Operate at scale** by means of template management, batch operations to provide preconfigured team hubs with appropriate permissions, data management controls, and integration with other workplace and business applications.
