# Cloud ERP Finance

Cloud ERP finance applications are rapidly evolving as automation, AI and composable architectures reshape the market amid rising regulatory and economic pressures. CFOs can use this research to identify vendors that deliver data-driven insights and future-ready finance solutions.

## Market Definition

Gartner defines ERP finance as a cloud-based application that enables organizations to manage a wide range of transactional financial processes including, but not limited to, general ledger, accounts payable and accounts receivable. The application serves as the system of record for finance that generates and stores accounting entries in accordance with accounting standards, facilitating the production of accurate financial statements and disclosures. It supplies finance with transactional and financial reports to support daily operations and provide insights into the financial health of the organization.

ERP finance supports the finance function by centralizing and streamlining transactional processes within a single application. It enables finance to access a standard enterprise data model that promotes visibility to key financial and transactional metrics, provides the data source for both external reporting and internal management reporting, and ultimately supports better decision making.

Common business problems addressed by ERP finance include:

**Reduce the risk and cost of noncompliance:** Automating accounting entries and financial controls across transactional processes ensures accurate financial reporting and adherence to regulatory requirements, protecting the organization from potential legal and financial penalties.

**Mitigate business continuity risks:** Operating on outdated or unsupported on-premises ERP poses risks such as revenue loss during downtime, data security breaches and noncompliance with industry regulations. These risks are critical to mitigate to ensure business continuity and operational resilience.

**Eliminate organizational inefficiencies:** Providing a common platform that standardizes and automates routine finance processes addresses and streamlines operations, enabling the organization to scale and grow.

**Enhance financial visibility:** Enabling a standard data model that connects operational data with financial data offers insights into financial metrics and supports data-driven decision making.
