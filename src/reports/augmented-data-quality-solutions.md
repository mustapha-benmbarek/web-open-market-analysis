## Market Definition

Gartner defines augmented data quality (ADQ) solutions as a set of capabilities for enhanced data quality experience aimed at improving insight discovery, next-best-action suggestions and process automation by leveraging AI/machine learning (ML) features, graph analysis and metadata analytics. Each of these technologies can work independently, or cooperatively, to create network effects that can be used to increase automation and effectiveness across abroad range of data quality use cases. These purpose-built solutions include a range of functions such as profiling and monitoring; data transformation; rule discovery and creation; matching, linking and merging; active metadata support; data remediation and role-based usability.

These packaged solutions help implement and support the practice of data quality assurance, mostly embedded as part of a broader data and analytics (D&A) strategy. Various existing and upcoming use cases include: **Analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning development, Data engineering, D&A governance, Master data management, Operational/transactional data quality**
